abstract = {A study was conducted of 97 projects identified as failures by the
projects' managers or parent organizations. Using the project
implementation profile, a set of managerially controllable factors is
identified as associated with project failure. The factors differed
according to three contingency variables: the precise way in which
failure was defined; the type of project, and the stage of the project
in its life cycle. Implications for project management and for future
research on failed projects are discussed. The results demonstrated
empirical justification for a multidimensional construct of project
failure, encompassing both internal efficiency and external
effectiveness aspects. The fact that the critical factors associated
with failure depended on the way in which failure is defined suggests
that it is necessary to know considerably more about how project
managers define failure (and success) and, indeed how the parent
organization makes judgments on the matter},

@incollection{Jacob2008,
abstract = {Virtual memory is one technique for managing the resource of physical memory, including the caches, main memory, and disk subsystem. It provides software with the illusion of a very large amount of main memory. The basic function of virtual memory is to create a virtual-machine environment for every process, which among other things allows text, data, and stack regions to begin at statically known locations in all processes without fear of conflict. It is the primary client of the memory system, in that a user process is not aware of physical memory and does not access it directly. Different architectures provide support for operating system features in very different ways. One of the fundamental differences is their treatment of address spaces. The chapter presents a taxonomy describing the architectural organization and protection of an address space. A system's interrupt mechanism, memory map, and page table/TLB combinations comprise the heart of a typical virtual memory system, one of the most fundamental services that a modern operating system provides. It highlights the operating system's use of and response to precise interrupts, arguably the fundamental building block of today's multi-tasking systems. This chapter presents a definition for a base in-order pipeline and then adds support for nested interrupts and virtual memory management via a MIPS-like memory map, page table, and TLB.},

An indirect addressing method is described in detail and various methods of implementation compared. The memory overhead and the time penalty (in memory accesses) are given as a function of memory size and method of implementation. It is concluded that a computed address table look-up technique should be used and that the block size should be either 256 or 512 words.},

This benign neglect can result in serious consequences to individuals and organizations, ranging from tarnished reputations to civil and criminal liability. Ethics and Project Management demonstrates the importance of making ethics a key consideration in managing projects and describes the impacts that occur when ethical transgressions arise.Providing the tools necessary for project managers to avoid an ethical lapse that can put themselves and their organization at risk, this volume:Defines ethics and places it within the project management contextDiscusses the contents of the Project Management Institute’s code of ethicsEnables project managers to recognize the trends that precipitate ethical dilemmas on a projectDemonstrates how ethical concerns permeate the entire project life cycleProvides tips on establishing a governance protocol to ensure ethical complianceExplores legal issues that arise from unethical behaviorExamines how ethical concerns on a project can have global implications, and how to operate in international settings with cultural differencesEach chapter ends with a Getting Started Checklist, facilitating immediate application of the concepts discussed and making it easy for project managers to determine whether they are in compliance with ethical standards. Providing a solid roadmap for the ethical health of a project, this volume is essential reading for all those concerned with avoiding the disastrous consequences of a cavalier approach to ethics.Praise for the book:... a great desktop reference for any project manager.

abstract = {Acknowledgments Publishing a book is an extended process that involves a number of people.Writing the final manuscript is just a small part of the big picture. This section is dedicated to all the people who directly, and indirectly, lent me their help. First and foremost, I would like to thank Jim Hill ofWordware Publishing for giving me the opportunity to write a book and believ- ing in me. I would also like to extend thanks toWes Beckwith and Beth Kohler.Wes, in addition to offering constant encouragement, does a great job of putting up with my e-mails and handling the vari- ous packages that I send. Beth Kohler, who performed the incredible task of reading my first book forWordware in a matter of days, has also been invaluable. I first spoke with Barry Brey back in the mid-1990s when I became interested in protected mode programming. He has always taken the time to answer my questions and offer his insight. Barry wrote the first book on the Intel chip set back in 1984. Since then, he has written well over 20 books. His current textbook on Intel’s IA32 processors is in its sixth edition. This is why I knew I had to ask Barry to be the technical editor for this book. Thanks, Barry. “Look, our middleware even runs on that littleWindows NT piece of crap.” —George Matkovitz “Hey, who was the \%\&\^{}\$ son of a \&*\$\# who wrote this optimized load of . . . oh, it was me.” —Mike Adler Mike Adler and George Matkovitz are two old fogeys who worked at Control Data back when Seymour Cray kicked the tar out of IBM. George helped to implement the world’s first message-passing operating system at Control Data. Mike also worked on a number of groundbreaking system software projects. I met these two codgers while performing R\&D for an ERP vendor in the Midwest. I hadn’t noticed how much these engineers had influenced me until I left Minnesota for California. It was almost as though I had learned through osmosis. A lot of my core understanding of software and the computer industry in general is based on the bits of hard-won advice and lore that these gentlemen passed on to me. I distinctly remember walking into Mike’s office and asking him, “Hey Mike, how do you build an operating system?” I would also like to thank Frank Merat, a senior professor at Case Western Reserve University. Frank has consistently shown interest in my work and has offered his support whenever he could. There is no better proving ground for a book than an established research university. Finally, I would like to thank SonicWALL, Inc. for laying me off and giving me the opportunity to sit around and think. The days I spent huddled with my computers were very productive.},

abstract = {Pointer swizzling at page fault time is a novel address translation mechanism that exploits conventional address translation hardware. It can support huge address spaces efficiently without long hardware addresses; such large address spaces are attractive for persistent object stores, distributed shared memories, and shared address space operating systems. This swizzling scheme can be used to provide data compatibility across machines with different word sizes, and even to provide binary code compatibility across machines with different hardware address sizes. Pointers are translated (`swizzled') from a long format to a shorter hardware-supported format at page fault time. No extra hardware is required, and no continual software overhead is incurred by presence checks or indirection of pointers. This pagewise technique exploits temporal and spatial locality in much the same way as a normal virtual memory; this gives it many desirable performance characteristics, especially given the trend toward larger main memories. It is easy to implement using common compilers and operating systems},

The management of uncertainty is seen as a necessary condition for effective project management. Sources of uncertainty are wide ranging and have a fundamental effect on projects and project management. These sources are not confined to potential events, and include lack of information, ambiguity, characteristics of project parties, tradeoffs between trust and control mechanisms, and varying agendas in different stages of the project life cycle. Common project management practice does not address many fundamental sources of uncertainty, particularly in 'soft' projects where flexibility and tolerance of vagueness are necessary. More sophisticated efforts to recognise and manage important sources of uncertainty are needed. Such efforts need to encompass organisational capabilities, including some aspects of organisation culture and learning. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.},

@book{Kerzner2009,
abstract = {Project management has evolved from a management philosophy restricted to a few functional areas and regarded as something nice to have to an enterprise pro- ject management system affecting every functional unit of the company. Simply stated, project management has evolved into a business process rather than merely a project management process. More and more companies are now regarding project management as being mandatory for the survival of the firm. Organizations that were opponents of project management are now advocates. Management educators of the past, who preached that project management could not work and would be just another fad, are now staunch supporters. Project man- agement is here to stay. Colleges and universities are now offering graduate degrees in project management. The text discusses the principles of project management. Students who are interested in advanced topics, such as some of the material in Chapters 21 to 24 of this text, may wish to read one of my other texts, Advanced Project Management: Best Practices in Implementation (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2004), and Project Management Best Practices: Achieving Global Excellence (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2006).

@inproceedings{Rajwar2005,
abstract = {Writing concurrent programs is difficult because of the complexity of ensuring proper synchronization. Conventional lock-based synchronization suffers from well-known limitations, so researchers have considered nonblocking transactions as an alternative. Recent hardware proposals have demonstrated how transactions can achieve high performance while not suffering limitations of lock-based mechanisms. However, current hardware proposals require programmers to be aware of platform-specific resource limitations such as buffer sizes, scheduling quanta, as well as events such as page faults, and process migrations. If the transactional model is to gain wide acceptance, hardware support for transactions must be virtualized to hide these limitations in much the same way that virtual memory shields the programmer from platform-specific limitations of physical memory. This paper proposes virtual transactional memory (VTM), a user-transparent system that shields the programmer from various platform-specific resource limitations. VTM maintains the performance advantage of hardware transactions, incurs low overhead in time, and has modest costs in hardware support. While many system-level challenges remain, VTM takes a step toward making transactional models more widely acceptable.},

@book{Hansen1973,
abstract = {From the Preface MAIN GOAL This book tries to give students of computer science and professional programmers a general understanding of operating systems-the programs that enable people to share computers efficiently. To make the sharing of a computer tolerable, an operating system must enforce certain rules of behavior on all its users. One would therefore expect the designers of operating systems to do their utmost to make them as simple, efficient, and reliable as possible. A number of operating systems made in the early 1960's had these characteristics; but in the late 1960's designers were often overambitious and built enormous systems with poor performance. I see no inherent reason why operating systems should not reach the quality of program construction found in present compilers; this will require an understanding of the principles common to all operating systems and a consistent use of safe methods of designing large programs. It is my hope that this book will give you a start in this direction. I assume that you are familiar with the basic structure of computers and programming languages and have some experience in writing and testing non-trivial programs. In a few cases a knowledge of elementary calculus and probability theory is also needed. THEMES The main theme of the book is that operating systems are not radically different from other programs. The difficulties encountered in the design of efficient, reliable operating systems are the same as those one encounters in the design of other large programs, such as compilers or payroll programs. The historical importance of operating systems is that they led to the discovery of new principles of resource sharing, multiprogramming, and program construction. These principles have a general validity beyond operating systems, and I think that they should be taught as part of a core of computer science courses, following courses on programming languages, data structures, and computer structures. The purpose of an operating system is to share computational resources among competing users. To do this efficiently a designer must respect the technological limitations of these resources. Present computers consist of a small number of components (processors, store modules, and peripherals) which operate strictly sequentially. It is possible to multiplex a single processor and a small internal store (supported by a large backing store) among several computations to create the illusion that they are executed concurrently and have access to a large, homogeneous store. But these abstractions are not supported by the underlying technology, and if they are carried too far, the result is a total collapse of computational service known as thrashing. One of the difficulties of operating systems is the highly unpredictable nature of the demands made upon them. Independent users submit jobs with varying resource requirements at irregular intervals. An operating system is expected to schedule this unpredictable mixture of jobs in such a manner that the resources are utilized efficiently and the users can expect response within reasonably predictable times! The only way to satisfy these expectations is probably to put restrictions on the characteristics of jobs so the designer can take advantage of the expected usage of resources. This is certainly the main reason for the success of small, specialized operating systems. It also gives a plausible explanation of the failure of recent "general-purpose" operating systems which try to handle a much greater variety of jobs (in some cases for a variety of machine configurations as well). Although most components of present computers are sequential in nature, they can work simultaneously to some extent. This influences the design of operating systems so much that the subject can best be described as the management of shared multiprogramming systems. The main difficulty of multiprogramming is that concurrent activities can interact in a time-dependent manner which makes it practically impossible to locate programming errors by systematic testing. Perhaps, more than anything else, this explains the difficulty of making operating systems reliable. If we wish to succeed in designing large, reliable multiprogramming systems, we must use programming tools which are so well-structured that most time-dependent errors can be caught at compile time. It seems hopeless to try to solve this problem at the machine level of programming, nor can we expect to improve the situation by means of so-called "implementation languages," which retain the traditional "right" of systems programmers to manipulate addresses freely. I use the programming language Pascal throughout the text to define operating system concepts concisely by algorithms. Pascal combines the clarity needed for teaching with the efficiency required for design. It is easily understood by programmers familiar with Algol 60 or Fortran, but Pascal is a far more natural programming tool than these languages, particularly with respect to data structuring. As we go along, I extend Pascal with a well-structured notation for book contains eight chapters: Chapter 1 is an overview of operating systems. It defines the purpose of operating systems and outlines their historical development from early batch processing to recent interactive systems. It also points out the influence of technological constraints on the services offered by operating systems. Chapter 2 on sequential processes discusses the role of abstraction and structure in problem solving and the nature of computations. It summarizes structuring principles of data and sequential programs and gives an example of hierarchal 3 on concurrent processes emphasizes the role of reproducible behavior in program testing and compares various methods of process synchronization: simple and conditional critical regions, semaphores, message buffers, and event queues. It concludes with an analysis of the prevention of deadlocks by a hierarchal ordering of process interactions. Chapters 2 and 3 present an abstract view of computational processes and their representation in programming languages. The following Chapters, 4 to 6, discuss techniques of implementing processes on computers with limited resources. This problem is mainly technological, and it seems unrealistic to look for a unifying view of how different kinds of components are used efficiently. I try to describe various techniques and point out under which circumstances they are successful. Chapter 4 on processor management discusses the short-term problems of scheduling concurrent processes on a limited number of processors at the lowest level of programming. It also explains the implementation of synchronizing primitives and evaluates the influence of these abstractions on the real-time characteristics of a system. Chapter 5 on store management considers the short-term problems of sharing an internal store of limited capacity among concurrent processes. It summarizes current store technology and explains the influence of recursive procedures, concurrent processes, and dynamic relocation on store addressing. It ends with an analysis of placement algorithms and store multiplexing. Chapter 6 analyzes the performance of various medium-term scheduling algorithms. It uses elementary queuing theory to derive analytical results for the average response time to user requests in a single processor system with these priority rules: first-come first-served, shortest job next, highest response ratio next, and round robin. Foregound-background scheduling is 7 is concerned with resource protection-the problem of ensuring that physical resources and data are accessed by well-defined operations within computations authorized to use them. This is a fundamental problem of program design which should have been presented earlier in the book, if only I understood it better. It is handled inadequately in all present operating systems. As fragments of a solution I mention two of the more systematic techniques used: the class concept in Simula 67 and the capability concept. It is important that a designer of operating systems understand the underlying common principles. But the danger of this division of the subject into separate chapters is that you may find it difficult to see how they fit together into a working system and be unaware of the more subtle interactions between, say, process communication, store management, input/output, and preemptive scheduling. I have therefore tried to describe a complete operating system in some detail in Chapter 8. It is a case study of the RC 4000 multiprogramming system. It is by no means an ideal system, but it is the only one I know in detail, and is regarded as a consistent, simple, and reliable design which illustrates the concepts and implementation of concurrent processes. It should perhaps be explained why there are no chapters on input/ output and filing systems. For a particular operating system, considerations about how these tasks are handled are highly relevant. But in this book I have concentrated on the more elementary aspects of these complicated tasks, namely process synchronization, store management, scheduling, and each chapter many words are first used intuitively to give you a feeling for the subject. Later I return to these words and try to give reasonably precise verbal definitions of their meaning. My use of a common word may not always agree completely with the various shades of meaning it has acquired elsewhere, but I hope to justify the usefulness of the concept behind the word and show that it is possible to describe operating systems in an informal but consistent terminology. The most important terms are collected in a Vocabulary section at the end of the book. LITERATURE This book is},

abstract = {The Sleator-Tarjan competitive analysis of paging (Comm. ACM28 (1985), 202-208) gives us the ability to make strong theoretical statements about the performance of paging algorithms without making probabilistic assumptions on the input. Nevertheless practitioners voice reservations about the model, citing its inability to discern between LRU and FIFO (algorithms whose performances differ markedly in practice), and the fact that the theoretical comptitiveness of LRU is much larger than observed in practice, In addition, we would like to address the following important question: given some knowledge of a program′s reference pattern, can we use it to improve paging performance on that program? We address these concerns by introducing an important practical element that underlies the philosophy behind paging: locality of reference. We devise a graph-theoretical model, the access graph, for studying locality of reference. We use it to prove results that address the practical concerns mentioned above, In addition, we use our model to address the following questions: How well is LRU likely to perform on a given program? Is there a universal paging algorithm that achieves (nearly) the best possible paging performance on every program? We do so without compromising the benefits of the Sleator-Tarjan model, while bringing it closer to practice.},

Our empirical evidence is a survey of 130 public sector projects in Norway, run within a national e-government program. We find that ICT based service innovation is not associated with a tightly run project (focused on cost, time and quality) or a professional project manager. Rather, successful service innovation is found in projects with a strong integration with the service providing organization and the external users of the services.
