@book{Eberhart2007,
abstract = {Russ Eberhart and Yuhui Shi have succeeded in integrating various natural and engineering disciplines to establish Computational Intelligence. This is the first comprehensive textbook, including lots of practical examples. -Shun-ichi Amari, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, JapanThis book is an excellent choice on its own, but, as in my case, will form the foundation for our advanced graduate courses in the CI disciplines. -James M. Keller, University of Missouri-ColumbiaThe excellent new book by Eberhart and Shi asserts that computational intelligence rests on a foundation of evolutionary computation. This refreshing view has set the book apart from other books on computational intelligence. The book has an emphasis on practical applications and computational tools, which are very useful and important for further development of the computational intelligence field. -Xin Yao, The Centre of Excellence for Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications, BirminghamThe soft analytic tools that comprise the field of computational intelligence have matured to the extent that they can, often in powerful combination with one another, form the foundation for a variety of solutions suitable for use by domain experts without extensive programming experience.Computational Intelligence: Concepts to Implementations provides the conceptual and practical knowledge necessary to develop solutions of this kind. Focusing on evolutionary computation, neural networks, and fuzzy logic, the authors have constructed an approach to thinking about and working with computational intelligence that has, in their extensive experience, proved highly effective. Features Moves clearly and efficiently from concepts and paradigms to algorithms and implementation techniques by focusing, in the early chapters, on the specific concepts and paradigms that inform the authors' methodologies. Explores a number of key themes, including self-organization, complex adaptive systems, and emergent computation. Details the metrics and analytical tools needed to assess the performance of computational intelligence tools. Concludes with a series of case studies that illustrate a wide range of successful applications. Presents code examples in C and C++. Provides, at the end of each chapter, review questions and exercises suitable for graduate students, as well as researchers and practitioners engaged in self-study. Makes available, on a companion website, a number of software implementations that can be adapted for real-world applications.

@book{Tanendbaum2009,
abstract = {For software development professionals and computer science students, Modern Operating Systems gives a solid conceptual overview of operating system design, including detailed case studies of Unix/Linux and Windows 2000. Readers familiar with Tanenbaum's previous text, Operating Systems, know the author is a great proponent of simple design and hands-on experimentation. His earlier book came bundled with the source code for an operating system called Minux, a simple variant of Unix and the platform used by Linus Torvalds to develop Linux. Although this book does not come with any source code, he illustrates many of his points with code fragments (C, usually with Unix system calls). The first half of Modern Operating Systems focuses on traditional operating systems concepts: processes, deadlocks, memory management, I/O, and file systems. There is nothing ground-breaking in these early chapters, but all topics are well covered, each including sections on current research and a set of student problems. It is the second half of the book that differentiates itself from older operating systems texts. Here, each chapter describes an element of what constitutes a modern operating system-awareness of multimedia applications, multiple processors, computer networks, and a high level of security. The chapter on multimedia functionality focuses on such features as handling massive files and providing video-on-demand. Included in the discussion on multiprocessor platforms are clustered computers and distributed computing. Finally, the importance of security is discussed-a lively enumeration of the scores of ways operating systems can be vulnerable to attack, from password security to computer viruses and Internet worms. Included at the end of the book are case studies of two popular operating systems: Unix/Linux and Windows 2000. There is a bias toward the Unix/Linux approach, not surprising given the author's experience and academic bent, but this bias does not detract from Tanenbaum's analysis. Both operating systems are dissected, describing how each implements processes, file systems, memory management, and other operating system fundamentals. Tanenbaum's mantra is a simple, accessible operating system design. Given that modern operating systems have extensive features, he is forced to reconcile physical size with simplicity. Towards this end, he makes frequent references to the Frederick Brooks classic The Mythical Man Month for wisdom on managing large, complex software development projects. He finds both Windows 2000 and Unix/Linux guilty of being too complicated-with a particular skewering of Windows 2000 and its "mammoth Win32 API". A primary culprit is the attempt to make operating systems more "user-friendly," which Tanenbaum views as an excuse for bloated code. The solution is to have smart people, the smallest possible team, and well-defined interactions between various operating systems components. Future operating system design will benefit if the advice in this book is taken to heart. -Pete Ostenson - Dieser Text bezieht sich auf eine vergriffene oder nicht verf\"{u}gbare Ausgabe dieses Titels.},

@book{Kliem2012,
abstract = {Ethics plays a critical role in project management, but all too often, its importance is overlooked. This benign neglect can result in serious consequences to individuals and organizations, ranging from tarnished reputations to civil and criminal liability. Ethics and Project Management demonstrates the importance of making ethics a key consideration in managing projects and describes the impacts that occur when ethical transgressions arise.Providing the tools necessary for project managers to avoid an ethical lapse that can put themselves and their organization at risk, this volume:Defines ethics and places it within the project management contextDiscusses the contents of the Project Management Institute’s code of ethicsEnables project managers to recognize the trends that precipitate ethical dilemmas on a projectDemonstrates how ethical concerns permeate the entire project life cycleProvides tips on establishing a governance protocol to ensure ethical complianceExplores legal issues that arise from unethical behaviorExamines how ethical concerns on a project can have global implications, and how to operate in international settings with cultural differencesEach chapter ends with a Getting Started Checklist, facilitating immediate application of the concepts discussed and making it easy for project managers to determine whether they are in compliance with ethical standards. Providing a solid roadmap for the ethical health of a project, this volume is essential reading for all those concerned with avoiding the disastrous consequences of a cavalier approach to ethics.Praise for the book:... a great desktop reference for any project manager. It is a must-have title to complete any project management library and I recommend it to both new and highly experienced project managers.—Gregg D.

@book{Kerzner2009,
abstract = {Project management has evolved from a management philosophy restricted to a few functional areas and regarded as something nice to have to an enterprise pro- ject management system affecting every functional unit of the company. Simply stated, project management has evolved into a business process rather than merely a project management process. More and more companies are now regarding project management as being mandatory for the survival of the firm. Organizations that were opponents of project management are now advocates. Management educators of the past, who preached that project management could not work and would be just another fad, are now staunch supporters. Project man- agement is here to stay. Colleges and universities are now offering graduate degrees in project management. The text discusses the principles of project management. Students who are interested in advanced topics, such as some of the material in Chapters 21 to 24 of this text, may wish to read one of my other texts, Advanced Project Management: Best Practices in Implementation (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2004), and Project Management Best Practices: Achieving Global Excellence (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2006). John Wiley \& Sons will also be introducing a five-book series on project management best practices, co-authored by Frank Saladis and Harold Kerzner, to accompany the above two books.},
