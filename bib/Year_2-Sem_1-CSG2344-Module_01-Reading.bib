@article{Pinto1990,
abstract = {A study was conducted of 97 projects identified as failures by the
projects' managers or parent organizations. Using the project
implementation profile, a set of managerially controllable factors is
identified as associated with project failure. The factors differed
according to three contingency variables: the precise way in which
failure was defined; the type of project, and the stage of the project
in its life cycle. Implications for project management and for future
research on failed projects are discussed. The results demonstrated
empirical justification for a multidimensional construct of project
failure, encompassing both internal efficiency and external
effectiveness aspects. The fact that the critical factors associated
with failure depended on the way in which failure is defined suggests
that it is necessary to know considerably more about how project
managers define failure (and success) and, indeed how the parent
organization makes judgments on the matter},

abstract = {WHEN THE MANAGEMENT of Sophisticated Sys- tems Company saw that the life of one of their more profitable product lines was rapidly fading, they jumped at an opportunity to develop a similar but more sophisticated product. An experienced team was assigned to carry out the design and get the product into manufacturing within twelve months. However, a year and a half and several million dollars later, tlie first prototype still had not passed system tests, and some members of the board were wondering whether the whole idea should be dropped. The project management sys- tem which had been developed to a high state in this company had unexpectedly failed.},

abstract = {PM Solutions Research first surveyed organizations about their Project Portfolio Management (PPM) practices in 2003. A decade later, weâ€™ve taken another look at a phenomenon that is changing the way organizations are managed and narrowing the gap between project/program management and corporate leadership. Our findings are encouraging and, at the same time, indicate those areas that organizations need to focus on to optimize the value of PPM. We had 495 respondents to this survey.},
