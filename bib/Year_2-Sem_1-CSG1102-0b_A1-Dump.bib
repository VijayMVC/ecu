@article{Rosene1967,
abstract = {In multiprocessor systems it is desirable to look for and allocate storage without extensive data moving. Two techniques for accomplishing this, associative memory techniques and indirect addressing techniques, are described. It is concluded that the two methods are similar in performance, but that indirect addressing is more economical. An indirect addressing method is described in detail and various methods of implementation compared. The memory overhead and the time penalty (in memory accesses) are given as a function of memory size and method of implementation. It is concluded that a computed address table look-up technique should be used and that the block size should be either 256 or 512 words.},

abstract = {Acknowledgments Publishing a book is an extended process that involves a number of people.Writing the final manuscript is just a small part of the big picture. This section is dedicated to all the people who directly, and indirectly, lent me their help. First and foremost, I would like to thank Jim Hill ofWordware Publishing for giving me the opportunity to write a book and believ- ing in me. I would also like to extend thanks toWes Beckwith and Beth Kohler.Wes, in addition to offering constant encouragement, does a great job of putting up with my e-mails and handling the vari- ous packages that I send. Beth Kohler, who performed the incredible task of reading my first book forWordware in a matter of days, has also been invaluable. I first spoke with Barry Brey back in the mid-1990s when I became interested in protected mode programming. He has always taken the time to answer my questions and offer his insight. Barry wrote the first book on the Intel chip set back in 1984. Since then, he has written well over 20 books. His current textbook on Intel’s IA32 processors is in its sixth edition. This is why I knew I had to ask Barry to be the technical editor for this book. Thanks, Barry. “Look, our middleware even runs on that littleWindows NT piece of crap.” —George Matkovitz “Hey, who was the \%\&\^{}\$ son of a \&*\$\# who wrote this optimized load of . . . oh, it was me.” —Mike Adler Mike Adler and George Matkovitz are two old fogeys who worked at Control Data back when Seymour Cray kicked the tar out of IBM. George helped to implement the world’s first message-passing operating system at Control Data. Mike also worked on a number of groundbreaking system software projects. I met these two codgers while performing R\&D for an ERP vendor in the Midwest. I hadn’t noticed how much these engineers had influenced me until I left Minnesota for California. It was almost as though I had learned through osmosis. A lot of my core understanding of software and the computer industry in general is based on the bits of hard-won advice and lore that these gentlemen passed on to me. I distinctly remember walking into Mike’s office and asking him, “Hey Mike, how do you build an operating system?” I would also like to thank Frank Merat, a senior professor at Case Western Reserve University. Frank has consistently shown interest in my work and has offered his support whenever he could. There is no better proving ground for a book than an established research university. Finally, I would like to thank SonicWALL, Inc. for laying me off and giving me the opportunity to sit around and think. The days I spent huddled with my computers were very productive.},

@inproceedings{Rajwar2005,
abstract = {Writing concurrent programs is difficult because of the complexity of ensuring proper synchronization. Conventional lock-based synchronization suffers from well-known limitations, so researchers have considered nonblocking transactions as an alternative. Recent hardware proposals have demonstrated how transactions can achieve high performance while not suffering limitations of lock-based mechanisms. However, current hardware proposals require programmers to be aware of platform-specific resource limitations such as buffer sizes, scheduling quanta, as well as events such as page faults, and process migrations. If the transactional model is to gain wide acceptance, hardware support for transactions must be virtualized to hide these limitations in much the same way that virtual memory shields the programmer from platform-specific limitations of physical memory. This paper proposes virtual transactional memory (VTM), a user-transparent system that shields the programmer from various platform-specific resource limitations. VTM maintains the performance advantage of hardware transactions, incurs low overhead in time, and has modest costs in hardware support. While many system-level challenges remain, VTM takes a step toward making transactional models more widely acceptable.},

abstract = {The Sleator-Tarjan competitive analysis of paging (Comm. ACM28 (1985), 202-208) gives us the ability to make strong theoretical statements about the performance of paging algorithms without making probabilistic assumptions on the input. Nevertheless practitioners voice reservations about the model, citing its inability to discern between LRU and FIFO (algorithms whose performances differ markedly in practice), and the fact that the theoretical comptitiveness of LRU is much larger than observed in practice, In addition, we would like to address the following important question: given some knowledge of a program′s reference pattern, can we use it to improve paging performance on that program? We address these concerns by introducing an important practical element that underlies the philosophy behind paging: locality of reference. We devise a graph-theoretical model, the access graph, for studying locality of reference. We use it to prove results that address the practical concerns mentioned above, In addition, we use our model to address the following questions: How well is LRU likely to perform on a given program? Is there a universal paging algorithm that achieves (nearly) the best possible paging performance on every program? We do so without compromising the benefits of the Sleator-Tarjan model, while bringing it closer to practice.},

abstract = {We present an extension to classical separation logic which allows reasoning about virtual memory. Our logic is formalised in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover in a manner allowing classical separation logic notation to be used at an abstract level. We demonstrate that in the common cases, such as user applications, our logic reduces to classical separation logic. At the same time we can express properties about page tables, direct physical memory access, virtual memory access, and shared memory in detail. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@incollection{Jacob2008,
abstract = {Virtual memory is one technique for managing the resource of physical memory, including the caches, main memory, and disk subsystem. It provides software with the illusion of a very large amount of main memory. The basic function of virtual memory is to create a virtual-machine environment for every process, which among other things allows text, data, and stack regions to begin at statically known locations in all processes without fear of conflict. It is the primary client of the memory system, in that a user process is not aware of physical memory and does not access it directly. Different architectures provide support for operating system features in very different ways. One of the fundamental differences is their treatment of address spaces. The chapter presents a taxonomy describing the architectural organization and protection of an address space. A system's interrupt mechanism, memory map, and page table/TLB combinations comprise the heart of a typical virtual memory system, one of the most fundamental services that a modern operating system provides. It highlights the operating system's use of and response to precise interrupts, arguably the fundamental building block of today's multi-tasking systems. This chapter presents a definition for a base in-order pipeline and then adds support for nested interrupts and virtual memory management via a MIPS-like memory map, page table, and TLB.},
