@article{Chu1976,
abstract = {Virtual memory is one of the major concepts that has evolved in computer architecture over the last decade. It has had a great impact on the design of new computer systems since it was first introduced by the designers of the Atlas computer in 1962. A virtual memory is usually divided into blocks of contiguous locations to allow an efficient mapping of the logical addresses into the physical address space. In this paper, we are concerned with paging systems, that is, systems for which the blocks of contiguous locations are of equal size. The memory system consists of two levels: main memory and auxiliary memory. The occurrence of a reference to a page that is currently not in main memory is called a page fault. A page fault results in the interruption of the program and the transfer of the referenced page from auxiliary to main memory.},

abstract = {We present a feasibility study for performing virtual address
translation without specialized translation hardware. Removing address
translation hardware and instead managing address translation in
software has the potential to make the processor design simpler,
smaller, and more energy-efficient at little or no cost in performance.
The purpose of this study is to describe the design and quantify its
performance impact. Trace-driven simulations show that software-managed
address translation is just as efficient as hardware-managed address
translation. Moreover, mechanisms to support such features as shared
memory, superpages, fine-grained protection, and sparse address spaces
can be defined completely in software, allowing for more flexibility
than in hardware-defined mechanisms},

@article{Albers2005,
abstract = {Motivated by the fact that competitive analysis yields too pessimistic results when applied to the paging problem, there has been considerable research interest in refining competitive analysis and in developing alternative models for studying online paging. In this paper, we propose a new, simple model for studying paging with locality of reference. The model is closely related to Denning's working set concept and directly reflects the amount of locality that request sequences exhibit. We use the page fault rate to evaluate the quality of paging algorithms, which is the performance measure used in practice. We develop tight or nearly tight bounds on the fault rates achieved by popular paging algorithms such as LRU, FIFO, deterministic Marking strategies and LFD. These bounds show that LRU is an optimal online algorithm, whereas FIFO and Marking strategies are not optimal in general. We present an experimental study comparing the page fault rates proven in our analyses to the page fault rates observed in practice. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In multiprocessor systems it is desirable to look for and allocate storage without extensive data moving. Two techniques for accomplishing this, associative memory techniques and indirect addressing techniques, are described. It is concluded that the two methods are similar in performance, but that indirect addressing is more economical. An indirect addressing method is described in detail and various methods of implementation compared. The memory overhead and the time penalty (in memory accesses) are given as a function of memory size and method of implementation. It is concluded that a computed address table look-up technique should be used and that the block size should be either 256 or 512 words.},

@article{Borodin1995,
abstract = {The Sleator-Tarjan competitive analysis of paging (Comm. ACM28 (1985), 202-208) gives us the ability to make strong theoretical statements about the performance of paging algorithms without making probabilistic assumptions on the input. Nevertheless practitioners voice reservations about the model, citing its inability to discern between LRU and FIFO (algorithms whose performances differ markedly in practice), and the fact that the theoretical comptitiveness of LRU is much larger than observed in practice, In addition, we would like to address the following important question: given some knowledge of a program′s reference pattern, can we use it to improve paging performance on that program? We address these concerns by introducing an important practical element that underlies the philosophy behind paging: locality of reference. We devise a graph-theoretical model, the access graph, for studying locality of reference. We use it to prove results that address the practical concerns mentioned above, In addition, we use our model to address the following questions: How well is LRU likely to perform on a given program? Is there a universal paging algorithm that achieves (nearly) the best possible paging performance on every program? We do so without compromising the benefits of the Sleator-Tarjan model, while bringing it closer to practice.},
