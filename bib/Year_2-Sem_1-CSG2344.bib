@article{Pinto1990,
abstract = {A study was conducted of 97 projects identified as failures by the
projects' managers or parent organizations. Using the project
implementation profile, a set of managerially controllable factors is
identified as associated with project failure. The factors differed
according to three contingency variables: the precise way in which
failure was defined; the type of project, and the stage of the project
in its life cycle. Implications for project management and for future
research on failed projects are discussed. The results demonstrated
empirical justification for a multidimensional construct of project
failure, encompassing both internal efficiency and external
effectiveness aspects. The fact that the critical factors associated
with failure depended on the way in which failure is defined suggests
that it is necessary to know considerably more about how project
managers define failure (and success) and, indeed how the parent
organization makes judgments on the matter},

@article{Atkinson2006,
abstract = {This paper builds on discussions that took place over a series of meetings in the UK of the Rethinking Project Management Network. The management of uncertainty is seen as a necessary condition for effective project management. Sources of uncertainty are wide ranging and have a fundamental effect on projects and project management. These sources are not confined to potential events, and include lack of information, ambiguity, characteristics of project parties, tradeoffs between trust and control mechanisms, and varying agendas in different stages of the project life cycle. Common project management practice does not address many fundamental sources of uncertainty, particularly in 'soft' projects where flexibility and tolerance of vagueness are necessary. More sophisticated efforts to recognise and manage important sources of uncertainty are needed. Such efforts need to encompass organisational capabilities, including some aspects of organisation culture and learning. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.},

@book{Kliem2012,
abstract = {Ethics plays a critical role in project management, but all too often, its importance is overlooked. This benign neglect can result in serious consequences to individuals and organizations, ranging from tarnished reputations to civil and criminal liability. Ethics and Project Management demonstrates the importance of making ethics a key consideration in managing projects and describes the impacts that occur when ethical transgressions arise.Providing the tools necessary for project managers to avoid an ethical lapse that can put themselves and their organization at risk, this volume:Defines ethics and places it within the project management contextDiscusses the contents of the Project Management Institute’s code of ethicsEnables project managers to recognize the trends that precipitate ethical dilemmas on a projectDemonstrates how ethical concerns permeate the entire project life cycleProvides tips on establishing a governance protocol to ensure ethical complianceExplores legal issues that arise from unethical behaviorExamines how ethical concerns on a project can have global implications, and how to operate in international settings with cultural differencesEach chapter ends with a Getting Started Checklist, facilitating immediate application of the concepts discussed and making it easy for project managers to determine whether they are in compliance with ethical standards. Providing a solid roadmap for the ethical health of a project, this volume is essential reading for all those concerned with avoiding the disastrous consequences of a cavalier approach to ethics.Praise for the book:... a great desktop reference for any project manager. It is a must-have title to complete any project management library and I recommend it to both new and highly experienced project managers.—Gregg D.

@book{Kerzner2009,
abstract = {Project management has evolved from a management philosophy restricted to a few functional areas and regarded as something nice to have to an enterprise pro- ject management system affecting every functional unit of the company. Simply stated, project management has evolved into a business process rather than merely a project management process. More and more companies are now regarding project management as being mandatory for the survival of the firm. Organizations that were opponents of project management are now advocates. Management educators of the past, who preached that project management could not work and would be just another fad, are now staunch supporters. Project man- agement is here to stay. Colleges and universities are now offering graduate degrees in project management. The text discusses the principles of project management. Students who are interested in advanced topics, such as some of the material in Chapters 21 to 24 of this text, may wish to read one of my other texts, Advanced Project Management: Best Practices in Implementation (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2004), and Project Management Best Practices: Achieving Global Excellence (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2006). John Wiley \& Sons will also be introducing a five-book series on project management best practices, co-authored by Frank Saladis and Harold Kerzner, to accompany the above two books.},

@article{Bygstad2009,
abstract = {In this paper we investigate to what extent ICT based service innovation can be successfully facilitated by traditional project management thinking. Should service innovation initiatives be organized the same way as high-tech product innovation, i.e. with expert teams in well structured projects? Or should they be organized in some looser fashion, with more interaction with users and other stakeholders? Our empirical evidence is a survey of 130 public sector projects in Norway, run within a national e-government program. We find that ICT based service innovation is not associated with a tightly run project (focused on cost, time and quality) or a professional project manager. Rather, successful service innovation is found in projects with a strong integration with the service providing organization and the external users of the services. We discuss three alternative models as an agenda for further research. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.},

@article{Atkinson1999e,
abstract = {This paper provides some thoughts about success criteria for IS–IT project management. Cost, time and quality (The Iron Triangle), over the last 50 years have become inextricably linked with measuring the success of project management. This is perhaps not surprising, since over the same period those criteria are usually included in the description of project management. Time and costs are at best, only guesses, calculated at a time when least is known about the project. Quality is a phenomenon, it is an emergent property of peoples different attitudes and beliefs, which often change over the development life-cycle of a project. Why has project management been so reluctant to adopt other criteria in addition to the Iron Triangle, such as stakeholder benefits against which projects can be assessed? This paper proposes a new framework to consider success criteria, The Square Route},
