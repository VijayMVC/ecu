@book{Kliem2012,
abstract = {Ethics plays a critical role in project management, but all too often, its importance is overlooked. This benign neglect can result in serious consequences to individuals and organizations, ranging from tarnished reputations to civil and criminal liability. Ethics and Project Management demonstrates the importance of making ethics a key consideration in managing projects and describes the impacts that occur when ethical transgressions arise.Providing the tools necessary for project managers to avoid an ethical lapse that can put themselves and their organization at risk, this volume:Defines ethics and places it within the project management contextDiscusses the contents of the Project Management Institute’s code of ethicsEnables project managers to recognize the trends that precipitate ethical dilemmas on a projectDemonstrates how ethical concerns permeate the entire project life cycleProvides tips on establishing a governance protocol to ensure ethical complianceExplores legal issues that arise from unethical behaviorExamines how ethical concerns on a project can have global implications, and how to operate in international settings with cultural differencesEach chapter ends with a Getting Started Checklist, facilitating immediate application of the concepts discussed and making it easy for project managers to determine whether they are in compliance with ethical standards. Providing a solid roadmap for the ethical health of a project, this volume is essential reading for all those concerned with avoiding the disastrous consequences of a cavalier approach to ethics.Praise for the book:... a great desktop reference for any project manager. It is a must-have title to complete any project management library and I recommend it to both new and highly experienced project managers.—Gregg D.

abstract = {PM Solutions Research first surveyed organizations about their Project Portfolio Management (PPM) practices in 2003. A decade later, we’ve taken another look at a phenomenon that is changing the way organizations are managed and narrowing the gap between project/program management and corporate leadership. Our findings are encouraging and, at the same time, indicate those areas that organizations need to focus on to optimize the value of PPM. We had 495 respondents to this survey.},

@book{Kerzner2009,
abstract = {Project management has evolved from a management philosophy restricted to a few functional areas and regarded as something nice to have to an enterprise pro- ject management system affecting every functional unit of the company. Simply stated, project management has evolved into a business process rather than merely a project management process. More and more companies are now regarding project management as being mandatory for the survival of the firm. Organizations that were opponents of project management are now advocates. Management educators of the past, who preached that project management could not work and would be just another fad, are now staunch supporters. Project man- agement is here to stay. Colleges and universities are now offering graduate degrees in project management. The text discusses the principles of project management. Students who are interested in advanced topics, such as some of the material in Chapters 21 to 24 of this text, may wish to read one of my other texts, Advanced Project Management: Best Practices in Implementation (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2004), and Project Management Best Practices: Achieving Global Excellence (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2006). John Wiley \& Sons will also be introducing a five-book series on project management best practices, co-authored by Frank Saladis and Harold Kerzner, to accompany the above two books.},

An experienced team was assigned to carry out the design and get the product into manufacturing within twelve months.

The project management sys- tem which had been developed to a high state in this company had unexpectedly failed.},

@article{Pinto1990,
abstract = {A study was conducted of 97 projects identified as failures by the
projects' managers or parent organizations. Using the project
implementation profile, a set of managerially controllable factors is
identified as associated with project failure. The factors differed
according to three contingency variables: the precise way in which
failure was defined; the type of project, and the stage of the project
in its life cycle. Implications for project management and for future
research on failed projects are discussed. The results demonstrated
empirical justification for a multidimensional construct of project
failure, encompassing both internal efficiency and external
effectiveness aspects. The fact that the critical factors associated
with failure depended on the way in which failure is defined suggests
that it is necessary to know considerably more about how project
managers define failure (and success) and, indeed how the parent
organization makes judgments on the matter},
