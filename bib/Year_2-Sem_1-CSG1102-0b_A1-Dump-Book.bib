abstract = {Acknowledgments Publishing a book is an extended process that involves a number of people.Writing the final manuscript is just a small part of the big picture. This section is dedicated to all the people who directly, and indirectly, lent me their help. First and foremost, I would like to thank Jim Hill ofWordware Publishing for giving me the opportunity to write a book and believ- ing in me. I would also like to extend thanks toWes Beckwith and Beth Kohler.Wes, in addition to offering constant encouragement, does a great job of putting up with my e-mails and handling the vari- ous packages that I send. Beth Kohler, who performed the incredible task of reading my first book forWordware in a matter of days, has also been invaluable. I first spoke with Barry Brey back in the mid-1990s when I became interested in protected mode programming. He has always taken the time to answer my questions and offer his insight. Barry wrote the first book on the Intel chip set back in 1984. Since then, he has written well over 20 books. His current textbook on Intel’s IA32 processors is in its sixth edition. This is why I knew I had to ask Barry to be the technical editor for this book. Thanks, Barry. “Look, our middleware even runs on that littleWindows NT piece of crap.” —George Matkovitz “Hey, who was the \%\&\^{}\$ son of a \&*\$\# who wrote this optimized load of . . . oh, it was me.” —Mike Adler Mike Adler and George Matkovitz are two old fogeys who worked at Control Data back when Seymour Cray kicked the tar out of IBM. George helped to implement the world’s first message-passing operating system at Control Data. Mike also worked on a number of groundbreaking system software projects. I met these two codgers while performing R\&D for an ERP vendor in the Midwest. I hadn’t noticed how much these engineers had influenced me until I left Minnesota for California. It was almost as though I had learned through osmosis. A lot of my core understanding of software and the computer industry in general is based on the bits of hard-won advice and lore that these gentlemen passed on to me. I distinctly remember walking into Mike’s office and asking him, “Hey Mike, how do you build an operating system?” I would also like to thank Frank Merat, a senior professor at Case Western Reserve University. Frank has consistently shown interest in my work and has offered his support whenever he could. There is no better proving ground for a book than an established research university. Finally, I would like to thank SonicWALL, Inc. for laying me off and giving me the opportunity to sit around and think. The days I spent huddled with my computers were very productive.},

abstract = {Virtual memory is one technique for managing the resource of physical memory, including the caches, main memory, and disk subsystem. It provides software with the illusion of a very large amount of main memory. The basic function of virtual memory is to create a virtual-machine environment for every process, which among other things allows text, data, and stack regions to begin at statically known locations in all processes without fear of conflict. It is the primary client of the memory system, in that a user process is not aware of physical memory and does not access it directly. Different architectures provide support for operating system features in very different ways. One of the fundamental differences is their treatment of address spaces. The chapter presents a taxonomy describing the architectural organization and protection of an address space. A system's interrupt mechanism, memory map, and page table/TLB combinations comprise the heart of a typical virtual memory system, one of the most fundamental services that a modern operating system provides. It highlights the operating system's use of and response to precise interrupts, arguably the fundamental building block of today's multi-tasking systems. This chapter presents a definition for a base in-order pipeline and then adds support for nested interrupts and virtual memory management via a MIPS-like memory map, page table, and TLB.},

abstract = {Virtual memory is a management technique that relies on the combined use of the main memory and a mass storage unit. This chapter describes virtual memory management concepts, rules and access rights. During the execution of a program, the processor generates virtual addresses that are sent to the memory management module. For the purpose of making it easier to understand the mechanisms, the chapter discusses the example of a machine equipped with 256 words of physical memory organized in 16 word pages, or 16 pages of 16 words and a mass storage unit with 1,024 words, or 64 pages of 16 words, set aside for the user's needs. To illustrate the mechanisms of two‐level paging used in virtual memory management systems, the chapter then presents an example of the practical implementation of the memory management modules. It finally provides another example to describe the concept of paged segmentation.},
