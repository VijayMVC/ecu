abstract = {Acknowledgments Publishing a book is an extended process that involves a number of people.Writing the final manuscript is just a small part of the big picture. This section is dedicated to all the people who directly, and indirectly, lent me their help. First and foremost, I would like to thank Jim Hill ofWordware Publishing for giving me the opportunity to write a book and believ- ing in me. I would also like to extend thanks toWes Beckwith and Beth Kohler.Wes, in addition to offering constant encouragement, does a great job of putting up with my e-mails and handling the vari- ous packages that I send. Beth Kohler, who performed the incredible task of reading my first book forWordware in a matter of days, has also been invaluable. I first spoke with Barry Brey back in the mid-1990s when I became interested in protected mode programming. He has always taken the time to answer my questions and offer his insight. Barry wrote the first book on the Intel chip set back in 1984. Since then, he has written well over 20 books. His current textbook on Intel’s IA32 processors is in its sixth edition. This is why I knew I had to ask Barry to be the technical editor for this book. Thanks, Barry. “Look, our middleware even runs on that littleWindows NT piece of crap.” —George Matkovitz “Hey, who was the \%\&\^{}\$ son of a \&*\$\# who wrote this optimized load of . . . oh, it was me.” —Mike Adler Mike Adler and George Matkovitz are two old fogeys who worked at Control Data back when Seymour Cray kicked the tar out of IBM. George helped to implement the world’s first message-passing operating system at Control Data. Mike also worked on a number of groundbreaking system software projects. I met these two codgers while performing R\&D for an ERP vendor in the Midwest. I hadn’t noticed how much these engineers had influenced me until I left Minnesota for California. It was almost as though I had learned through osmosis. A lot of my core understanding of software and the computer industry in general is based on the bits of hard-won advice and lore that these gentlemen passed on to me. I distinctly remember walking into Mike’s office and asking him, “Hey Mike, how do you build an operating system?” I would also like to thank Frank Merat, a senior professor at Case Western Reserve University. Frank has consistently shown interest in my work and has offered his support whenever he could. There is no better proving ground for a book than an established research university. Finally, I would like to thank SonicWALL, Inc. for laying me off and giving me the opportunity to sit around and think. The days I spent huddled with my computers were very productive.},

abstract = {Pointer swizzling at page fault time is a novel address translation mechanism that exploits conventional address translation hardware. It can support huge address spaces efficiently without long hardware addresses; such large address spaces are attractive for persistent object stores, distributed shared memories, and shared address space operating systems. This swizzling scheme can be used to provide data compatibility across machines with different word sizes, and even to provide binary code compatibility across machines with different hardware address sizes. Pointers are translated (`swizzled') from a long format to a shorter hardware-supported format at page fault time. No extra hardware is required, and no continual software overhead is incurred by presence checks or indirection of pointers. This pagewise technique exploits temporal and spatial locality in much the same way as a normal virtual memory; this gives it many desirable performance characteristics, especially given the trend toward larger main memories. It is easy to implement using common compilers and operating systems},

@inproceedings{Rajwar2005,
abstract = {Writing concurrent programs is difficult because of the complexity of ensuring proper synchronization. Conventional lock-based synchronization suffers from well-known limitations, so researchers have considered nonblocking transactions as an alternative. Recent hardware proposals have demonstrated how transactions can achieve high performance while not suffering limitations of lock-based mechanisms. However, current hardware proposals require programmers to be aware of platform-specific resource limitations such as buffer sizes, scheduling quanta, as well as events such as page faults, and process migrations. If the transactional model is to gain wide acceptance, hardware support for transactions must be virtualized to hide these limitations in much the same way that virtual memory shields the programmer from platform-specific limitations of physical memory. This paper proposes virtual transactional memory (VTM), a user-transparent system that shields the programmer from various platform-specific resource limitations. VTM maintains the performance advantage of hardware transactions, incurs low overhead in time, and has modest costs in hardware support. While many system-level challenges remain, VTM takes a step toward making transactional models more widely acceptable.},

abstract = {The Sleator-Tarjan competitive analysis of paging (Comm. ACM28 (1985), 202-208) gives us the ability to make strong theoretical statements about the performance of paging algorithms without making probabilistic assumptions on the input. Nevertheless practitioners voice reservations about the model, citing its inability to discern between LRU and FIFO (algorithms whose performances differ markedly in practice), and the fact that the theoretical comptitiveness of LRU is much larger than observed in practice, In addition, we would like to address the following important question: given some knowledge of a program′s reference pattern, can we use it to improve paging performance on that program? We address these concerns by introducing an important practical element that underlies the philosophy behind paging: locality of reference. We devise a graph-theoretical model, the access graph, for studying locality of reference. We use it to prove results that address the practical concerns mentioned above, In addition, we use our model to address the following questions: How well is LRU likely to perform on a given program? Is there a universal paging algorithm that achieves (nearly) the best possible paging performance on every program? We do so without compromising the benefits of the Sleator-Tarjan model, while bringing it closer to practice.},

This chapter describes virtual memory management concepts, rules and access rights. During the execution of a program, the processor generates virtual addresses that are sent to the memory management module. For the purpose of making it easier to understand the mechanisms, the chapter discusses the example of a machine equipped with 256 words of physical memory organized in 16 word pages, or 16 pages of 16 words and a mass storage unit with 1,024 words, or 64 pages of 16 words, set aside for the user's needs. To illustrate the mechanisms of two‐level paging used in virtual memory management systems, the chapter then presents an example of the practical implementation of the memory management modules. It finally provides another example to describe the concept of paged segmentation.},

abstract = {In multiprocessor systems it is desirable to look for and allocate storage without extensive data moving. Two techniques for accomplishing this, associative memory techniques and indirect addressing techniques, are described. It is concluded that the two methods are similar in performance, but that indirect addressing is more economical. An indirect addressing method is described in detail and various methods of implementation compared. The memory overhead and the time penalty (in memory accesses) are given as a function of memory size and method of implementation. It is concluded that a computed address table look-up technique should be used and that the block size should be either 256 or 512 words.},

@incollection{Jacob2008,
abstract = {Virtual memory is one technique for managing the resource of physical memory, including the caches, main memory, and disk subsystem. It provides software with the illusion of a very large amount of main memory. The basic function of virtual memory is to create a virtual-machine environment for every process, which among other things allows text, data, and stack regions to begin at statically known locations in all processes without fear of conflict. It is the primary client of the memory system, in that a user process is not aware of physical memory and does not access it directly. Different architectures provide support for operating system features in very different ways. One of the fundamental differences is their treatment of address spaces. The chapter presents a taxonomy describing the architectural organization and protection of an address space. A system's interrupt mechanism, memory map, and page table/TLB combinations comprise the heart of a typical virtual memory system, one of the most fundamental services that a modern operating system provides. It highlights the operating system's use of and response to precise interrupts, arguably the fundamental building block of today's multi-tasking systems. This chapter presents a definition for a base in-order pipeline and then adds support for nested interrupts and virtual memory management via a MIPS-like memory map, page table, and TLB.},

@book{Tanendbaum2009,
abstract = {For software development professionals and computer science students, Modern Operating Systems gives a solid conceptual overview of operating system design, including detailed case studies of Unix/Linux and Windows 2000. Readers familiar with Tanenbaum's previous text, Operating Systems, know the author is a great proponent of simple design and hands-on experimentation. His earlier book came bundled with the source code for an operating system called Minux, a simple variant of Unix and the platform used by Linus Torvalds to develop Linux. Although this book does not come with any source code, he illustrates many of his points with code fragments (C, usually with Unix system calls). The first half of Modern Operating Systems focuses on traditional operating systems concepts: processes, deadlocks, memory management, I/O, and file systems. There is nothing ground-breaking in these early chapters, but all topics are well covered, each including sections on current research and a set of student problems. It is the second half of the book that differentiates itself from older operating systems texts. Here, each chapter describes an element of what constitutes a modern operating system-awareness of multimedia applications, multiple processors, computer networks, and a high level of security. The chapter on multimedia functionality focuses on such features as handling massive files and providing video-on-demand. Included in the discussion on multiprocessor platforms are clustered computers and distributed computing. Finally, the importance of security is discussed-a lively enumeration of the scores of ways operating systems can be vulnerable to attack, from password security to computer viruses and Internet worms. Included at the end of the book are case studies of two popular operating systems: Unix/Linux and Windows 2000. There is a bias toward the Unix/Linux approach, not surprising given the author's experience and academic bent, but this bias does not detract from Tanenbaum's analysis. Both operating systems are dissected, describing how each implements processes, file systems, memory management, and other operating system fundamentals. Tanenbaum's mantra is a simple, accessible operating system design. Given that modern operating systems have extensive features, he is forced to reconcile physical size with simplicity. Towards this end, he makes frequent references to the Frederick Brooks classic The Mythical Man Month for wisdom on managing large, complex software development projects. He finds both Windows 2000 and Unix/Linux guilty of being too complicated-with a particular skewering of Windows 2000 and its "mammoth Win32 API". A primary culprit is the attempt to make operating systems more "user-friendly," which Tanenbaum views as an excuse for bloated code. The solution is to have smart people, the smallest possible team, and well-defined interactions between various operating systems components. Future operating system design will benefit if the advice in this book is taken to heart. -Pete Ostenson - Dieser Text bezieht sich auf eine vergriffene oder nicht verf\"{u}gbare Ausgabe dieses Titels.},
