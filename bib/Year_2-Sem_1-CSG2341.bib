@book{Eberhart2007,
abstract = {Russ Eberhart and Yuhui Shi have succeeded in integrating various natural and engineering disciplines to establish Computational Intelligence. This is the first comprehensive textbook, including lots of practical examples. -Shun-ichi Amari, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, JapanThis book is an excellent choice on its own, but, as in my case, will form the foundation for our advanced graduate courses in the CI disciplines. -James M. Keller, University of Missouri-ColumbiaThe excellent new book by Eberhart and Shi asserts that computational intelligence rests on a foundation of evolutionary computation. This refreshing view has set the book apart from other books on computational intelligence. The book has an emphasis on practical applications and computational tools, which are very useful and important for further development of the computational intelligence field. -Xin Yao, The Centre of Excellence for Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications, BirminghamThe soft analytic tools that comprise the field of computational intelligence have matured to the extent that they can, often in powerful combination with one another, form the foundation for a variety of solutions suitable for use by domain experts without extensive programming experience.Computational Intelligence: Concepts to Implementations provides the conceptual and practical knowledge necessary to develop solutions of this kind. Focusing on evolutionary computation, neural networks, and fuzzy logic, the authors have constructed an approach to thinking about and working with computational intelligence that has, in their extensive experience, proved highly effective. Features Moves clearly and efficiently from concepts and paradigms to algorithms and implementation techniques by focusing, in the early chapters, on the specific concepts and paradigms that inform the authors' methodologies. Explores a number of key themes, including self-organization, complex adaptive systems, and emergent computation. Details the metrics and analytical tools needed to assess the performance of computational intelligence tools. Concludes with a series of case studies that illustrate a wide range of successful applications. Presents code examples in C and C++. Provides, at the end of each chapter, review questions and exercises suitable for graduate students, as well as researchers and practitioners engaged in self-study. Makes available, on a companion website, a number of software implementations that can be adapted for real-world applications.

@book{Luger2009,
abstract = {This accessible, comprehensive book captures the essence of artificial intelligence - solving the complex problems that arise wherever computer technology is applied. With his signature enthusiasm, George Luger demonstrates numerous techniques and strategies for addressing the many challenges facing computer scientists today. Diverse topics on this exciting and ever-evolving field range from perception and adaptation using neural networks and genetic algorithms, intelligent agents with ontologies, automated reasoning, natural language analysis, and stochastic approaches to machine learning. This book is ideal for a one - or two-semester university course on AI. New to this edition: A new chapter on stochastic approaches to machine learning, including first-prder Bayesian networks, variants of hidden Markov models, inference with Markov random fields and loopy belief propagation. Presentation of parameter fitting with expectation maximization learning and structure learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. Use of Markov decision processes in reinforcement learning. Presentation of agent technology and the use of ontologies. Natural language processing with dynamic programming (the Earley parser) and other probabilistic parsing techniques including Viterbi. A new supplemental programming book is available: AI Algorithms in Prolog, Lisp, and Java. Available online and in print, this book demonstrates these languages as tools for building many of the algorithms presented throughout Luger's AI book.},
