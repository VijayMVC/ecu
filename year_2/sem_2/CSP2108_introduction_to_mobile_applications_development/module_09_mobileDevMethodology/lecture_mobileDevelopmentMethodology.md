# Development methodologies for mobile apps

## Software development methodologies

- Projects benefit from good management
- Various software development methodologies have been developed over time for different types of projects

## Methodology overview

### Waterfall

- Sequential development
    - Requirements
    - Design
    - Implementation
    - Testing
    - Deployment
    - Maintenance
- Emphasis on
    - Tight control
    - Planning
    - Deadlines

### Incremental

- Series of mini water falls, each covering part of the system
- Series of incremental mini waterfalls within an overall design context
- System core define via waterfall
    - Then incremental implementation

### Spiral

- Cycles through
    - Determine objectives
    - Identify and resolve risks
    - Develop and test
    - Plan next cycle
- Increasing scope with each cycle

### Rapid application development (RAD)

- Iterative use of prototypes
- Iterates over
    - Requirements planning
    - Prototyping
- Output combines
    - Business requirements
    - Technical design

### Agile

- Iterative development
- Continuous feedback
- Using cross functional teams
- Example
    - Scrum

## Why use agile for mobile app dev

- Constraints of platform
    - Limited screen size
    - Limited storage
    - Short sessions
    - Small downloads
    - Network connectivity
        - Experiment with options
        - Reduce redundant features
- Users not familiar with apps
    - Use of prototypes / incremental updates etc. for user feedback
- Rapid pace of change
- In app instrumentation / analytics
    - Refine apps based on experience
- Device diversity
    - Need for frequent revision / test across range of devices and OS
- Users do not tolerate crashes / errors
    - Frequent testing during development

## Scrum loop

- Product over creates prioritized wish list
    - Product backlog
- During sprint planning
    - Team pulls a small chunk from top of backlog
        - Sprint backlog
    - Team decides how to implement components
- Team has certain amount of time to complete work
    - Usually two to four weeks
- Meet each day to assess progress
    - Daily scrum
- Scrum master keeps team focused on goal
- At end of sprint, work should be shippable
    - Ready to hand to customer
    - Show to stakeholder
    - Put on shelf store
- Sprint ends with review and retrospective
- As next sprint begins
    - Team chooses another chunk of product backlog
    - Loop begins again

## Assignment as scrum

- Backlog

### Assignment scrum roles

- Product owner
    - Unit coordinator is stakeholder
- Development team
    - Students
- Scrum master
    - Could be any team member
    - More like a coach / facilitator

### Sprints

- Sprint contents
    - One sprint per project requirement
- Length of sprint
    - One week for each sprint

### Sprint planning

- Attempt sprint planning for first sprint
    - What can get done
    - How will it get done

## How well would it work

- Imagine using scrum for the project
    - Daily scrum
    - Weekly sprint review / retro
    - Maintain product backlog / sprint backlog
- How well do you think this would work / why?
