# CSI2441 Applications development

## Unit details

This unit will take students through the necessary steps for the development of well built and correctly implemented web applications. While the unit works with languages and systems in the web context, a vast majority of the concepts and practices involved are applicable to any type of quality application development. The structure of the unit exposes students to multiple web programming languages so that students can get a feel for how different environments are coded, and how fundamentally, most languages and very similar. In the first half of the unit we will look at 'hand-coding' two popular scripting languages, namely Active Server Pages (ASP) in Visual Basic and also PHP 5. Whilst ASP is starting to show its age a little now, it still has a massive installed user base on the web and maintenance programmers (and even new developers) and still in demand. PHP is perhaps the most popular scripting language in use for modern web developers due to its power, flexibility and its cross platform nature (plus it is very friendly to code in). We will use both of this languages in the first half of the unit for skills building, concept testing and building a simple, but very rigorous application.

In the second half of the semester we will concentrate our practical focus on Rapid Application Development (RAD) environments where we do less hand coding and more drag and drop coding, using code objects and back end databases the application core. For this we will use ASP.NET within Microsoft's Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

### Textbooks

The original textbook for this unit WAS the following;

>Farrell, J. (2006).  Programming logic and design, comprehensive (4th ed.). New York : Course Technology.

HOWEVER, this book has been removed as a required text. Some of the lecture materials will still be based on it, however it is not required for the workshops or assignments. For reference, students can refer to it in the library closed reserve, however the exam will be based on the lecture materials, online readings and practical assignment / workshop elements of the unit.

### Workload

Traditionally, this unit requires a significant amount of work on behalf of students in order to successfully complete. During the re-authoring process, the unit has been designed to get students up and running quickly by providing a pre-configured web server/scripting/database environment ready for use at home or on-campus, including instructions on setting it up and testing it. Between reading the lectures and weekly readings and completing the comprehensive workshops, you should calendar at least 10 hours a week to this unit, perhaps even more in the early stages. In the past, students have indicated that this is one of the harder units they have done, yet also among the most rewarding due to the skills and knowledge it provides.

I am usually available on the Mt Lawley campus five days a week (appointments are required though), and constantly check my email, forums and phone messages.  Please feel free to contact me about issues with the unit, unit materials or anything else that I can be of assistance with during your time within this unit.  Also, please ensure that all emails regarding the unit contain your student id, name and unit code and only come from your ECU student email account.

### Assignments, extensions and appeals

In order to be fair and equal to all students, I am a stickler for the rules. Thus, late assignments will be penalised (unless a doctor's certificate or note from the student councellor is provided before the assignment due date), and beyond five working days, will not be marked. All assignments are to come in via MyECU's assignment submission system - assignments via email will not be accepted (as they are way too hard to track). All assignments will be marked AS IS - so please do not forget to put items in before you submit, as the submission system only allows one submissions per student per assignment.

## Unit rules

### Communication

- Always use your ECU student email account when communicating with ECU staff members.
- Freemail messages such as those from hotmail, yahoo or gmail mail are automatically filtered out.
- Include your name and unit-code in the subject line in all correspondence.
- Please sign off your email with your given name as I consider it rude to receive an email that is not signed.
- Similarly, when leaving a telephone message please state your name, the unit you are studying and what your query concerns.
- Be specific and to the point in all communications.
- Allow a minimum of two working days for a reply (though it is usually less than this)
- Is the answer to your question in the lecture notes, tutorial or reading materials?
	- Check before contacting your tutor or lecturer.

### Assessments

- Submit your assignments via the Blackboard Assessments area (do NOT email them).
- Check the unit code and assessment details to ensure that you are submitting the assignment in the correct place for your unit code.
- Assignments can be submitted only ONCE, SO CHECK THAT YOU HAVE INCLUDED ALL MATERIALS – late materials will not be accepted.
- Submit ONE file ONLY. This should contain a title page, the body of the assignment and the references.
- Late penalties will be applied according to university rules, without exception.
- Assignment extensions must be submitted on the official form and must have supporting documentation from a Doctor or counsellor. These must be submitted BEFORE the assignment due date. Extensions cannot be granted after the assignment due date.
- An extension based on a medical certificate is for the length of time indicated on the medical certificate (thus, a one week extension will not be given if the medical certificate reads ‘two days sick’).
- Students have 15 working days from the return of their assignment to appeal the result, thus appealing results at the end of semester cannot be done.

### Exams

- Deferred exams have different questions from the original exam.
- In nearly all cases, students are only offered Supp exams if they have met the criteria for one, it is not up to individual lecturers as to whether a Supp is to be offered.
- If you have handed in no work for the semester and do not attend the original exam, applications for deferred exams will be cancelled.

### Quality results

- Ask relevant questions.
- Read the assignment description CAREFULLY and often.
- Use the library, use books and journals – avoid websites and other ‘easy sources’ (online peer-reviewed journals are acceptable).
- Start the assignment early.
- Be self reliant.
- Review, review, review, the first draft should never be the last.
- Assume that the materials you are provided with are a starting point (say 25-30%) – you are expected to research and apply the rest.
- If you are studying a fulltime load (3+ units) it is expected that you will work as such. Fulltime work cannot be used as the basis of appeal if you are also studying fulltime.

### Final word

- Most problems can be solved quickly and easily BEFORE assignment time / end of semester.
- Small problems can become HUGE problems after assignment time / end of semester – so seek help early.
- Staff are not responsible for student decisions.
- Assignments in this unit will be marked as quickly as possible, fairly and accurately.
- Student feedback is more than welcome, it is encouraged.
- Over the years it has become apparent that: "hard work makes a unit easy, while shortcuts to success lead to failure" (Dr Justin Brown, ECU)
