- Project managers must coordinate all of the other knowledge areas throughout project lifecycle
- Many new project managers have trouble looking at the big picture
	- Want to focus on too many details
- Project integration management is not software integration
- Project integration management occurs within the whole organization
	- It involves interface management
		- Stakeholders
		- Clients/customers
		- Project team members
		- Senior management
		- Project opponents
		- Other project managers

### Project integration management processes

#### Develop the project charter

- Work with stakeholders to create the document that formally authorizes a project
	- The charter

#### Develop the preliminary project scope statement

- Work with stakeholders to develop high level scope requirements
	- Users of project's product/service/results
- Create preliminary project scope statement

#### Develop the project management plan

- Coordinate all planning efforts to create a consistent and coherent document
	- Project management plan

#### Direct and manage project execution

- Carrying out the project management plan by performing the activities included in it

#### Monitor and control the project work

- Overseeing project work to meet the performance objectives of the project

#### Perform integrated change control

## What went wrong

- Airbus A380 project
	- Two years behind schedule
	- Caused parent company to face expected loss
		- $6.1 billion over next four years
- Project suffered from severe integration management problems
	- Wiring harnesses didn't fit properly in plane
		- Pre-assembled bundles containing hundreds of miles of cabin wiring
	- Assembly slowed to near standstill
		- Workers tried to pull bundles apart and re-thread them through fuselage

## Strategic planning and project selection

- Strategic planning
	- Involves determining
		- Long term objectives
		- Predicting future trends
		- Projecting needs for new products/services
- Organizations perform SWOT analysis
	- Strengths
	- Weaknesses
	- Opportunities
	- Threats
- As part of strategic planning
	- Identify potential projects
	- Use realistic methods to select which projects to work on
	- Formalize project initiation by issuing a project charter

### IT project planning process

![it project planning process](http://snag.gy/KcP79.jpg)

### New product development (NPD) best practice

- Only one in seven product concepts come to fruition
	- Companies must have disciplined and systematic approach to new product development (NPD) projects based on best practices
- New product development (NPD) success criteria
	- Product innovation and technology strategy for the business
	- Resource commitment and focusing on
		- Right projects
		- Solid portfolio management
	- Effective, flexible and streamlined idea to launch process
	- Right climate and culture for innovation
		- True cross functional teams
		- Senior management commitment to NPD

### Methods for selecting projects

- Usually more projects than available time/resources to implement them
- Methods for selecting projects
	- Focus of broad organizational needs
	- Categorize IT projects
	- Perform net present value (NPV) or other financial analysis
	- Use weighted scoring model
	- Implement balanced scorecard

#### Focusing on broad organizational needs

- Often difficult to provide strong justification for many IT projects
	- But everyone agrees they have high value
- Important criteria for projects
	- There is a need for the project
	- There are funds available
	- There is a strong will to make project succeed

### Categorizing IT projects

- Possible project classes
	- Addressing
		- Problem
		- Opportunity
		- Directive
	- Length of project
		- When is project product needed
	- Priority of project

### Financial analysis of projects

- Primary methods for determining projected financial value of projects
	- Net present value (NPV)
	- Return on investment (ROI)
	- Payback analysis

#### Net present value (NPV)

- Calculates expected net monetary gain/loss from a project
- Discount all expected future cash in/outflows to present point in time
- Projects with positive NPV should be considered
	- If financial value is key criteria
- Higher NPV scores are better

##### NPV calculation

- Determine estimated costs/benefits for life of the project and products it produces
- Determine the discount rate
	- Check with organization
- Calculate NPV
- Some organizations consider the investment year as year 0
	- Others start in year 1
	- Some people enter costs as negative numbers
		- Others don't
	- Check with organization for preference

##### NPV example

![npv example](http://snag.gy/Y67xv.jpg)

##### JWD consulting NPV example

![jwd npv example](http://snag.gy/iEaRD.jpg)

#### Return on investment (ROI)

- Calculated by subtracting project costs from benefits then dividing by discounted costs

>ROI = ((total discounted benefits) - (total discounted costs)) / (discounted costs)

- Higher ROI the better
- Many organizations have a required **rate of return**
	- Minimum acceptable rate of ROI for projects
- **Internal rate of return (IRR)**
	- Calculated by finding the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero

#### Payback analysis

- Payback period
	- Amount of time it will take to recoup the total cost invested in a project
		- In net cash inflows
- Occurs when net cumulative discounted benefits equals the costs
- Many organizations what IT projects to have fairly short payback period

![payback period](http://snag.gy/Mg1Lh.jpg)

#### Balanced scorecard

- Converts organizations value drivers to a series of defined metrics
	- Customer service
	- Innovation
	- Operational efficiency
	- Financial performance
- See [balancedscorecard.org](http://balancedscorecard.org/)

![balanced scorecard 1](http://snag.gy/iGiBu.jpg)

### Why firms invest in IT

1. Support explicit business objectives
2. Good internal rate of return
3. Support implicit business objectives
4. Good net present value (NPV)
5. Reasonable payback period
6. Used in response to competitive systems
7. Support management decision making
8. Meets budgetary constraints
9. High probability of achieving results
10. Good accounting rate of return

### Remember

- Organizations undertake projects for one of following reasons
	- Increased revenue
	- Decreased costs
	- Stay in business

![integrated change control process](http://snag.gy/sH08b.jpg)

#### Change control in IT projects

- Former view
	- Project team should strive to do exactly what was planned on time and within budget
- Problem
	- Stakeholders rarely agree up front on project scope
	- Time/cost estimates inaccurate
- Modern view
	- Project management is a process of constant communication and negotiation
- Solution
	- Changes are often beneficial
	- Project team should plan for them

#### Change control system

- Some organizations have policies in place for time sensitive changes
	- 48 hr policy
		- Allows project team members to make decisions
		- Have 48 hrs to reverse decision pending senior management approval
	- Delegate changes to lowest level possible
		- Keep everyone informed of changes

#### Suggestions for performing integrated change control

- View project management as a process of constant communication and negotiation
- Plan for change
- Establish a formal change control system
	- Include a change control board (CCB)
- Use effective configuration management
- Define procedures for making timely decisions on smaller changes
