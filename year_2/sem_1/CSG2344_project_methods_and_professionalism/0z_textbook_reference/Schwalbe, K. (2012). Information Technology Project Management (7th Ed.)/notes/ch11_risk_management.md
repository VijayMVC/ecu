## Importance of risk management

- Art/science of managing risk throughout project life
	- Identifying
	- Analyzing
	- Responding
- Can have positive impact on
	- Selecting projects
	- Determining scope
	- Developing realistic
		- Schedules
		- Cost estimates
- Helps
	- Project stakeholders understand nature of project
	- Involves team members define strengths/weaknesses
	- Integrate other project management knowledge areas
- Risk management not as visible as crisis management
	- Crisis management
		- Indicates obvious danger to success of project
		- Receives intense attention
		- Accompanied by more rewards than risk management
	- Risk management
		- Results in fewer problems
		- Faster resolutions
- PMI
	- Introduced PMI risk management professional (PMI-RMP) credential
- William Ibbs, Young H. Kwak study
	- Organizations need to put more effort into risk management
	- IT industry lowest ratings
		- 2.75/5
- Benefits from software risk management
	- Anticipate/avoid problems
	- Prevent surprises
	- Improve ability to negotiate
	- Meet customer commitments
	- Reduce schedule slips
	- Reduce cost overruns

### Definition of risk

- Risk is the possibility of loss or injury
	- Negativity associated with risk
	- Uncertainty involved
- Negative risk
	- Potential problems that might occur
	- Impede project success
	- Involves possible actions that project manager can take to manage risk
		- Avoid
		- Lessen
		- Change
		- Accept
- Positive risk/opportunities
	- Good outcomes
	- Like investing in opportunities
- Project risk definition
	- General definition
	- Uncertainty that can have negative/positive effect on meeting project objectives
- Risk management is an investment
	- Costs are associated with it
	- Amount of investment depends on
		- Nature of project
		- Experience of project team
		- Constraints imposed on both
	- Cost of risk management should not exceed potential benefits
- If so many risks in IT projects, why pursue?
	- Taking risks can create great opportunities
	- Organizations survive longer when they pursue opportunities
- Main questions
	- How to decide which projects to pursue
	- How to identify/manage risk throughout project lifecycle
- Some organizations only analyze tactical/negative risks
	- Can widen scope to encompass strategic risk and upside opportunities
	- Benefits
		- Bridge strategy and tactics gap
			- Ensure project delivery is tied to organizational needs/vision
		- Focus projects on benefits they exist to support
			- Rather than producing set of deliverables
		- Managing opportunities proactively as integral part of business processes
			- Both strategic and tactical level
		- Provide useful information to decision makers at all levels when environment is uncertain
		- Allow appropriate level of risk to be taken intelligently with full awareness of degree of uncertainty and its potential effects on objectives

### Balance risk and opportunities

- Risk appetite
	- Degree of uncertainty an entity is willing to take on
	- In anticipation of reward
- Risk tolerance
	- Max acceptable deviation an entity is willing to accept for project/business objectives as potential impact
- Project may be accepted if risks are
	- Within tolerance
	- Balanced with rewards gained by taking risk

### Risk preferences

- Risk utility
	- Amount of satisfaction/pleasure received from potential payoff

![risk utility](http://snag.gy/DaG1z.jpg)

- Risk averse
	- Utility rises at decreasing rate
	- More payoff or money is at stake
		- Gain less satisfaction
		- Lower tolerance
- Risk seeking
	- Higher tolerance
	- Satisfaction increases when payoff increases
	- Prefer outcomes that are more uncertain
	- Willing to pay penalty to take risks
- Risk neutral
	- Achieves balance between risk and payoff
	- Might not purchase item from vendor who has not been in business for specific period of time


### Goal

- Minimize potential negative risks
- Maximize potential positive risks
- Known risks
	- Risks that have been identified/analyzed
	- Can be managed proactively
- Unknown risk
	- Risks not identified
	- Cannot be managed
- Good practice to identify/manage project risks

	- Summarizes how risk management will be performed
	- Becomes subset of project management plan

### Risk management plan topics

#### Methodology

- How will risk management be performed
- What tools/data sources are available/applicable

#### Roles/responsibilties

- Which people are
	- Responsible for implementing specific tasks
	- Providing deliverables related to risk management

#### Budget/schedule

- What are estimated costs/schedules for performing risk related activities

#### Risk categories

- What are the main categories of risk that should be addressed
- Is there a risk breakdown structure

#### Risk probability/impact

- How will probabilities and impacts of risk items be assessed
- What scoring/interpretation methods will be used for qualitative/quantitative analysis
- How will probability/impact matrix be developed

#### Revised stakeholder tolerances

- How will changes affect project

#### Tracking

- How will team track risk management activities
- How will lessons learned be documented/shared
- How will risk management processes be audited

#### Risk documentation

- What reporting formats and processes will be used for risk management activities

### Contingency plan

- Predefined actions that project team will take if identified risk event occurs
- Example
	- If project team knows new release of software package may not be available in time to use for project
		- Might have contingency plan to use existing older version

### Fallback plan

- Developed for risks that have high impact on meeting project objectives
- Put into effect if attempts to reduce risk do not work
- Example
	- Plan A and plan B

### Contingency reserves/allowances

- Provisions held by project sponsor/organization to reduce risk of overruns to acceptable level
	- Cost
	- Schedule
- Contingency reserves
	- For known risks
- Management reserves
	- Funds held for unknown risks
- Example
	- If project appears to be off course because staff is inexperienced with new tech

### Suggestions for identifying risk

- Review
	- Project documentation
	- Recent/historical information related to organization
	- Assumptions that might affect project
- Hold meetings to discuss information
	- Ask important questions about how they relate to risk
- Four other common techniques
	- Brainstorming
	- Delphi technique
	- Interviewing
	- Root cause analysis

#### Brainstorming

- Group generates ideas for specific problem
	- Amassing ideas spontaneously without judgment
- Helps create comprehensive list of risks to address later
	- During qualitative/quantitative risk analysis
- Should be run by experienced facilitator
	- To keep ideas flowing
- Categorize ideas to make them more manageable
- Do not overuse/misuse brainstorming
	- People working alone produce greater number of ideas
	- Compared to working in groups
		- Fear of social disapproval
		- Effects of authority hierarchy
		- Domination of session by one or two vocal people
	- Can inhibit idea generation

#### Delphi technique

- Derive consensus among panel of experts who make predictions about future developments
- Systematic, interactive forecasting procedure based on
	- Independent and anonymous input regarding future events
- Uses repeated rounds of questioning and written responses
	- Feedback to responses in earlier rounds
- Take advantage of group input
	- While avoiding possible biasing effects of oral panel deliberations
- Must select panel of experts for particular subject

#### Interviewing

- Fact finding technique
- Collect information
	- Face to face
	- Phone
	- Email
	- IM discussions
- Interview people with similar project experience
	- Important tool for identifying risk
- Create list of questions to use as guide during interview

#### SWOT

- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Opportunities
- Threats
- Used in strategic planning
- Can be used to identify risk

#### Checklists

- Based on risks encountered in previous projects
- Provide meaningful template for understanding risks in current project

#### Analysis of assumptions

- Ensure assumptions are valid
- Invalid/incomplete/inconsistent assumptions can lead to identifying more risks

#### Creation of diagrams

- Cause/effect diagrams
- Fishbone diagrams
	- Root cause
- Flowcharts
	- How different parts interrelate
- Influence diagrams
	- Represent decision problems
	- Display essential elements
		- Decisions
		- Uncertainties
		- Causalities
		- Objectives
	- How they influence each other

### Risk register

- Contains results of various risk management processes
- Displayed in table/spreadsheet format
- Documents potential risks and related info

#### Risk event

- Specific, uncertain events that may occur to the detriment/enhancement of project
- Negative risk event
	- Performance failure of product created by project
	- Delays in completing work as scheduled
	- Increases in estimated costs
	- Supply shortages
	- Litigation against company
	- Strikes
- Positive risk event
	- Completing work sooner/cheaper than planned
	- Collaborating with suppliers to produce better products
	- Good publicity resulting from project

#### Risk register contents

- Identification number for each risk event
	- Unique descriptor
- Rank
	- 1 = highest risk
- Name
	- Example
		- Defective server
		- Late completion of testing
		- Reduced consulting costs
		- Good publicity
- Description
	- Provide more detailed description
- Category
	- ie. Technology risk
- Trigger
	- Indicators of symptoms of actual risk
- Potential responses
	- How will team respond to risk
- Risk owner
	- Who will take responsibility for risk
- Probability
	- ie. High/Medium/Low
- Impact to project
	- High/medium/low
- Status of risk
	- Did risk occur
	- Was response strategy completed
	- Is risk no longer relevant
-
