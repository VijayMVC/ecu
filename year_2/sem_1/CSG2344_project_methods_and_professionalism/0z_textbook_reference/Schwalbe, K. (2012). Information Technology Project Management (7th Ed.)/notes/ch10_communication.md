### Controlling communications

- Monitor / control project communications
- Ensures stakeholder communications are met

## Keys to good communication

- Important concepts
	- Focusing on individual / group communication needs
	- Using formal / informal methods for communication
	- Provide important information in an effective / timely manner
	- Setting stage for communicating bad news
	- Understanding communication channels

### Focusing on individual / group communication needs

- Managers think they can just add more people to a project that is falling behind schedule
	- Approach causes more setbacks
	- Due to increased complexity of communications
	- People are not interchangeable parts
	- Cannot assume that a task scheduled to take two months of a persons time can be done in one month by two people
		- ie. Nine women will not produce a baby in one month
- Understand individual / group preferences for communication
	- Personality traits can affect communication preferences
		- Introverts may prefer receiving praise in private
		- Extroverts want everyone to hear about their good work
		- Intuitive person may want to understand how something fits in big picture
		- Sensing person prefer to have more focused step by step details
		- Strong thinkers want to know the logic behind information
		- Feeling people want to know how information affects them personally / others
		- Judging person driven to meet deadlines with few reminders
		- Perceiving person needs more assistance in developing/following plans
	- Although every person is different
		- Cannot just generalize based on personality profile/traits
- Important to be aware of own communication styles
	- IT professionals have different traits than general population
		- More
			- Introverted
			- Intuitive
			- Orient to thinking
	- Personality differences can lead to miscommunication with people who are
		- Extroverted
		- Sensation oriented
		- Feeling
- Important to provide several methods of communication to promote open dialogue
	- Written words
	- Visuals
	- Videos
	- Meetings
	- Instead of assuming that receiver understands
		- Build in a feedback loop to make sure
- Difficult for people to admit they do not understand something
	- Must be patient and flexible when communicating information
	- Focus on making sure their messages are understood
	- Cannot overcommunicate
- Geographic location and cultural background also affect complexity of communication
	- Different countries
		- Difficult or impossible to schedule times for two way communication during business hours
		- Language barriers
			- Same word may have different meanings in different languages
		- Times/dates/units of measure interpreted differently
	- Cultural differences
		- May communicate in ways that make others uncomfortable
			- Women's rights
		- Reserve written documents for binding commitments
	- Research/understand nuances of communications

### Formal/informal methods of communicating

- Not enough for project team members to submit reports and assume everyone will read the reports
	- People prefer informal communications
	- 75% of people are extroverts
		- Prefer two way conversation about project rather than
			- Detailed reports
			- Emails
			- Web pages
- Colleagues/managers want to know the people working on projects
	- Develop trusting relationship
	- Use informal discussions to develop relationships
- Excellent project managers
	- Have ability to nurture relationships
	- Use empathetic listening skills
- Oral communication helps build stronger relationships among personnel and stakeholders
	- People like to interact with each other
		- Get a true feeling for how project is going
- Face to face communication
	- 58% through body language
	- 35% through how words are said
	- 7% through actual content
- Communication dimensions
	- Writing
	- Speaking
	- Listening
- People respond differently to different levels/types of communication
	- Project sponsor may prefer to stay informed through informal discussions over coffee
	- Project sponsor will give better feedback about project during informal talks than other forms of communication
	- Allows sponsor to exercise leadership and provide insights/information that are critical to project success
	- Face to face meetings are often more effective than electronic communication
		- Particularly for sensitive information

### Distributing important information in an effective / timely manner

- Important to
	- Include detailed technical information that affects critical performance features of products / services developed in project
	- Document any changes in technical specifications that might affect product performance
- Critical information must be clearly available
- People have tendency to avoid reporting bad news
	- ie. Reporting behind schedule
- Oral communication during meetings / informal talks brings important positive/negative information into the open
	- Good idea to have short frequent meetings
	- Can have "stand up" meetings
		- No chairs
		- Forces focus on communication
- Some companies ban email during certain parts of day or entire days of week
	- To encourage face to face

### Setting the stage for bad news

- Important to put information in context
	- Especially if bad news
- Know how problem will affect project/organization
- Can recommend steps to mitigate problem
- Project sponsors/managers want to know that the following has been evaluated
	- Impact of situation
	- Considered alternatives
	- Made recommendation based on expertise
- Should know how problem might affect bottom line
	- Use leadership skills to handle challenge

### Determine number of communication channels

- As number of people involved increases
	- Communcation complexity also increases

>(number of communication channels) = (n(n - 1)) / 2  
where n = number of people involved

- Limit size of teams/subteams to avoid making communications too complex
- Example
	- If three people are working on a task
		- They have three communications channels
	- If you add two more people to the team
		- You have 10 communication channels
	- If add three more people
		- 12 communications channels
- Consider factors before deciding how to distribute information
	- Size of group
	- Type of information
	- Appropriate medium
- As group size increases
	- Management challenges increase
	- Communicating badly exponentially increases possibility of making fatal mistakes
	- Much easier to address distrust among 5 people than with a team of 500 people
- Virtual project environment
	- Must rely on good written communication
- Share responsibility for project communications with entire project team

## Planning communications management

- Every project should include a communications plan
	- Guides project communications
	- Should be part of overall project management plan
	- Plan varies but should always be prepared
		- Small team
			- Can be part of team contract

- Consistent communication
	- Helps improve project communications
	- Coordinated with stakeholders
- WBS
	- Information about content of essential project communications comes from WBS
	- WBS include a section for project communications
		- Ensures that reporting key information is a project deliverable
	- If reporting essential information is an activity defined in the WBS
		- It becomes even more important to know what project information to report
		- When to report it
		- How to report it
		- Who is responsible for generating report

## Managing communications

- Getting information to right people at right time in useful format just as important as developing info in first place

	- Estimate projected completion date

#### Status review meetings
