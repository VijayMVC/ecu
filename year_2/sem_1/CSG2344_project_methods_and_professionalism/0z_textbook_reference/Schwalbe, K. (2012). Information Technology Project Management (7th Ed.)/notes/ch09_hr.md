	- Power
	- Effectiveness

### Motivation theories

- Intrinsic motivation
	- Participate in activity for own enjoyment
- Extrinsic motivation
	- Participate in activity for reward or avoid penalty

### Maslow's hierarchy of needs

- Unique qualities of human behavior
	- Love
	- Self-esteem
	- Belonging
	- Self-expression
	- Creativity
- People's behaviors are guided/motivated by sequence of needs
	1. Physiological
		- Food
		- Water
	2. Safety
		- Physical
		- Economic security
	3. Social
		- Acceptance
		- Love
		- Affection
		- Association with team/group
	4. Esteem
		- Recognition
		- Prestige
		- Status
	5. Self actualization
		- Challenging projects
		- Opportunities for innovation/creativity
- Each level of hierarchy is prerequisite for levels above
- Once a need is satisfied
	- It no longer serves as potent motivation of behavior

![maslow hierarchy of needs](https://doorwayproject.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/maslows-hierarchy-of-needs12.jpg)

- Bottom four needs are referred to as deficiency needs
	- Physiological
	- Safety
	- Socal
	- Esteem
- Highest level considered growth need
	- Self actualization
- Deficiency needs met first before growth needs
	- Self actualized people are
		- Problem focused
		- Have appreciation for life
		- Concerned about personal growth
		- Able to have peak experiences
- Project manager must understand
	- Team member's motivation
		- Social
		- Esteem
		- Self actualization
	- New team members might be motivated by social needs
		- Organize gatherings/social events for new workers
		- Older team members may view this as invasion of personal time
			- Time rather spent with friends/family
				- Or working on self actualization

### Herzberg's motivation-hygiene theory

- Distinguishes between motivational and hygiene factors in work setting
- Motivational
	- Cause job satisfaction
- Hygiene
	- Cause job dissatisfaction

| Hygiene factors                      | Motivators     |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| Larger salaries                      | Achievement    |
| More supervision                     | Recognition    |
| More attractive work environment     | Work itself    |
| Computer or other required equipment | Responsibility |
| Health benefits                      | Advancement    |
| Training                             | Growth         |

- Herzberg explained why motivation cannot be instilled by
	- Reducing time spent at work
	- Increasing wages
	- Offering fringe benefits
	- Providing human relations/sensitivity training
- People want to actualize themselves by being able to use
	- Creativity
	- Work on challenging projects
- Need stimuli to grow/advance and motivate
	- Aligned with Maslow's hierarchy of needs
	- Achievement
	- Recognition
	- Responsibility
	- Advancement
	- Growth

### McClelland's acquired-needs theory

- Person's specific needs are acquired or learned over time
	- Shaped by life experiences
- Categories
	- Achievement
	- Affiliation
	- Power
- One or two are dominant in people

#### Achievement

- Seek to excel
- Avoid low/high risk situations to improve chances for achieving something worthwhile
- Need regular feedback
- Prefer to work alone or with other high achievers
- Should be given challenging projects with achievable goals
- Should receive frequent performance feedback
	- Not motivated by money
		- But is effective form of feedback

#### Affiliation

- Desire relationships with other people
- Need to feel accepted by others
- Tend to conform to norms of work group
- Prefer work that involves significant personal interaction
- Create cooperative work environment
	- To meet needs of people with high need for affiliation

#### Power

- Desire either
	- Personal power
	- Institutional power
- Personal power
	- Want to direct others
	- Can be seen as bossy
- Institutional/social power
	- Want to organize others to further the goals of organization
- Provide them with opportunity to manage others
	- Emphasize importance of meeting organizational goals

#### Thematic apperception test (TAT)

- Measures individual needs according to McClelland's categories
- Presents subjects with ambiguous pictures
- Asks them to develop spontaneous story for each picture
	- Assuming they will project own needs into the story

### MgGregor's theory x / theory y

- Theory X
	- Workers dislike/avoid work if possible
	- Use control schemes to have workers make adequate effort to meet objectives
		- Coercion
		- Threats
	- Assumes average worker
		- Wants to be directed
		- Prefers to avoid responsibility
		- Little ambition
		- Wants security above all else
- Theory Y
	- Employees do not dislike work
	- Consider it as natural as play or rest
	- Significant rewards
		- Satisfaction of esteem/self-actualization needs

#### Theory Z

- William Ouchi
- Based on Japanese approach
- Emphasizes
	- Trust
	- Quality
	- Collective decision making
	- Cultural values
	- Job rotation
	- Broadening of skills
	- Generalization vs. Specification
	- Need for continuous training
- Theory X/Y from management to employee perspective
- Theory Z also from employee to management perspective
- Workers can be trusted to do their job to utmost ability
	- As long as management can be trusted to
		- Support them
		- Look out for their wellbeing

### Thamhain and Wilemon's influence and power

#### Influence

- Approaches project managers use to deal with workers
- Nine influence bases
	1. Authority
		- Legitimate hierarchical right to issue orders
	2. Assignment
		- Perceived ability to influence a worker's later work assignments
	3. Budget
		- Perceived ability to authorize others' use of discretionary funds
	4. Promotion
		- Ability to improve worker's position
	5. Money
		- Ability to increase worker's pay/benefits
	6. Penalty
		- Perceived ability to dispense or cause punishment
	7. Work challenge
		- Ability to assign work that capitalizes on worker's enjoyment of doing a particular task
		- Taps into intrinsic motivational factor
	8. Expertise
		- Perceived special knowledge that others deem important
	9. Friendship
		- Ability to establish friendly relationships between workers
- Assignment, budget, promotion, money, penalty influence bases not automatically available to project managers
- Projects more likely to fail when relying too heavily on
	- Authority
	- Money
	- Penalty
- Projects more likely to succeed when relying on
	- Work challenge
	- Expertise

#### Power

- Ability to influence behavior
	- To get people to do things they would not normally do
- Often used to force people into changing their behavior
- Five main types of power

##### Coercive power

- Punishment
- Threats
- Negative approaches
- Similar to influence category: Penalty
- Correlated with unsuccessful projects
	- But can be effective in stopping negative behavior

##### Legitimate power

- Based on position of authority
- Similar to influence category: Authority
- Can make key decisions without involving project team
- Overemphasis correlates with project failure

##### Expert power

- Use personal knowledge/expertise to get people to change behavior
- Perceived experts may have higher influence for people to follow suggestions

##### Reward power

- Incentives to influence people
	- Money
	- Status
	- Recognition
	- Promotion
	- Special work assignments
- Only certain types of rewards truly influence people to change behavior
	- Work challenge
	- Achievement/recognition

##### Referent power

- Based on charisma
- Held in high regard
	- Will cause influence based on regard
- Few people posses natural charisma for referent power

	- Not urgent
- Project managers
	- Do
		- Develop project plans
		- Building relationships with stakeholders
		- Mentoring project team members
	- Avoid
		- Focusing only on urgent activities

## Developing the HR plan

- Identify/document project
	- Roles
	- Responsibilities
	- Skills
	- Reporting relationships
- Includes
	- Organizational chart
	- Detailed information on roles/responsibilities
	- Staffing management plan

### Project organizational charts

![project organizational chart](http://snag.gy/eIEiy.jpg)


- **Deputy managers**
	- Fill in for project managers in their absence
	- Assist them as needed
- **Subproject managers**
	- Responsible for managing sub projects of divided large project
	- Structure is typical for large project using matrix organizational structure
- When project has many people
	- Clearly defining/allocating project work is essential
- Smaller projects may not require deputy/subproject managers
	- Might have team leaders reporting to project managers

### Work definition/assignment process

- Framework for defining/assigning work
	1. Finalizing the project requirements
	2. Defining how the work will be accomplished
	3. Breaking down the work into manageable elements
	4. Assigning work responsibilities

![work definition/assignment process](http://snag.gy/iat4w.jpg)

- Process is
	- Carried out during proposal and startup phases of project
	- Iterative
		- Takes more than one pass
- **Request for proposal (RFP)** or draft contract
	- Provides basis for defining/finalizing work requirements
	- Documented in a
		- Final contract
		- Technical baseline
	- If RFP not required
		- Internal project charter and scope statement will provide basis for defining/finalizing work requirements
- Project team leaders then decide on technical approach for how to do the work
	- Will work be broken down using product-oriented or phased approach?
	- Will some work be outsourced/subcontracted to other companies?
- Once approach defined
	- Develop WBS
	- Team develops activity definitions for WBS
- Then work is assigned
	- To organizational units
	- Base work assignments on where work fits in organization
	- Use **organizational breakdown structure (OBS)** to conceptualize process

#### Organizational breakdown structure (OBS)

- Shows which organizational units are responsible for which work items
- Can be based on general organizational chart
	- Broken down into more detail
	- Based on specific units within departments/subcontracted companies
- Example OBS categories
	- Software development
	- Hardware development
	- Training

### Responsibility assignment matrices (RAM)

- Maps work of project in WBS to people responsible in OBS

![ram](http://snag.gy/Lmshw.jpg)

- RAM allocates work to responsible/performing
	- Organizations
	- Teams
	- Individuals
- Depends on desired level of detail
	- Small projects
		- Assign to individuals
	- Large projects
		- Assign to organizational units/teams
- Can also be used to define general roles/responsibilities on projects
	- Can include stakeholders in project
	- ie. RACI chart

### RACI chart

- Show four key roles for project stakeholders
	- Responsibility
		- Who does the task
	- Accountability
		- Who signs off on the task or has authority for it
	- Consultation
		- Who has information necessary to complete task
	- Informed
		- Who needs to be notified of task status and results
- List tasks vertically
- List individuals/groups horizontally
- Each cell can contain R, A, C or I
- Multiple R, C, I entries
- Only one A entry to clarify who is accountable for each task

![raci chart](http://snag.gy/hdEA3.jpg)

### Staffing management plans

- Describe
	- Types of people needed to work on the project
		- Number of each type of person per month
	- How resources will be
		- Acquired
		- Trained
		- Rewarded
		- Reassigned after project

### Resource histogram

- Column chart
- Shows number of resources assigned to a project over time
- Columns represent number of people needed in each area
- Stack columns to identify number of people needed each month

![resource histogram](http://snag.gy/eQ3Pw.jpg)

## Acquiring the project team

- Project manager who is the smartest person on the team has done a poor job of recruiting
- Important to assign appropriate type and number of people to work on projects at appropriate times
- Resource assignment
- Resource loading
- Resource leveling

### Resource assignment

- Work with other people in organization to
	- Assign personnel to projects
	- Acquire additional human resources needed to staff project
- Strong influencing/negotiation skills used to get internal people to work on projects
- Must ensure people assigned to projects fit with their skills and needs of organization
- Output
	- Project staff assignments
	- Resource availability information
	- Updates to staffing management plan
	- Project team directory

#### Staffing plans

- Number/type of people who are
	- Currently in the organization
	- Needed for project based on current/upcoming activities
- Maintain complete/accurate inventory of employee skills
- If mismatch between skills and needs of organization
	- Address staffing and training needs

#### Hiring

- Important to have good procedures for hiring
	- Subcontractors
	- New employees
- Work with HR managers to address problems in recruiting appropriate people
- Address retention issues
- Strategies
	- Offer existing employees incentives for helping recruit/retain personnel
		- Pay employees $1 for every hour worked by new recruit
	- Provide benefits based on personal need
		- Work only 4 hours a week
		- Option to work from home
- Consider needs of individual and organization when making recruiting/retention decisions
	- Study best practices of leading companies in these areas

### Resource loading

- Problem/danger in scheduling process
	- Do not address issues of resource utilization and availability
- Schedules focuses on time rather than time and resources
	- Including people
- Important for project manager to balance trade-offs
	- Performance
	- Time
	- Cost
- Resolving trade-offs involve additional costs to organization
- Project manager must achieve project success without increasing costs/time to complete project
	- Key is to effectively manage human resources
- Resource loading
	- Refers to amount of individual resources that existing schedule requires during specific time periods
- Helps project managers understand demands of project on
	- Organizations resources
	- Individual people's schedules
- Use histograms to depict period-by-period variations in resource loading
	- Can be helpful in determining
		- Staffing needs
		- Identify staffing problems
	- Can also show when work is being overallocated to person or group

#### Overallocation

- Not enough resources are available to perform the assigned work during a given time period
- You need to provide good estimates of how many hours are required to accomplish work
- Typical worker does productive work between 70% to 80% of the time
	- Unrealistic to assume that all workers are 100% productive all of the time

### Resource leveling

- Technique for resolving resource conflicts by delaying tasks
- Form of network analysis
	- Resource management concerns drive scheduling decisions
		- Start/finish dates
- Main purpose
	- Create smoother distribution of resource usage
- Examine network diagram for areas of slack and float
	- Identify resource conflicts
- You can sometimes remove overallocations by
	- Delaying non-critical tasks
	- Delaying the project completion date to reduce/remove overallocations
- Underallocation can also occur
	- Change schedule to improve utilization of resource
- Resource leveling aims to
	- Minimize period-by-period variations in resource loading
	- Shifts task within their slack allowances

#### Resource leveling example

![resource leveling](http://snag.gy/Q5WlG.jpg)

- Activities A, B, C can all start at the same time
- Activity A
	- Duration 5 days
	- People 2
- Activity B
	- Duration 5 days
	- People 4
- Activity C
	- Duration 3 days
	- People 2
- Histogram on lower left corner
	- Shows resource usage if all activities start on day one
- Histogram on lower right corner
	- Shows resource usage if Activity C delayed by 2 days
		- Activity C's total slack allowance
- Lower right histogram is flat/leveled
	- Activities arranged to take up less space
	- Saves days and number of workers
	- Similar to Tetris

#### Benefits

- Resources are used on a more consistent bases
	- Requires less management
- May enable project managers to use a just-in-time inventory policy for subcontractors/expensive resources
	- ie. Level resources for work that must be done by subcontractor
		- Use 4 contracted consultants for 4 months
		- Rather than spread out work over more time or using more than 4 people
			- More costly
	- Can also use crashing/fast tracking techniques to improve schedule
- Results in fewer problems for project personnel and accounting departments
	- Increasing/decreasing labor levels can produce additional work/confusion
- Improves morale
	- Stability with jobs
	- Stressful for people not knowing what projects they will be working on from week to week or day to day

## Developing the team

- Goal
	- Help people work together more effectively to improve project performance
- Tuckerman's team development model
	1. Forming
		- Introduction of team members
		- Little work is actually achieved
	2. Storming
		- Team members have different opinions for how the team should operate
		- People test each other
		- Often conflict within the team
	3. Norming
		- Achieved when team members have developed common working method
		- Cooperation/collaboration replaces conflict/mistrust of previous phase
	4. Performing
		- Emphasis is on reaching team goals rather than working on team process
		- Relationships settled
		- Team members likely to build loyalty to each other
		- Team is able to manage tasks that are more complex and cope with greater change
	5. Adjourning
		- Break up of team after successfully reaching goal and completes work

### Training

- Provide training in just-in-time fashion
- E-learning opportunities
	- Employees can learn specific skills any time/place
	- More cost effective than traditional instructor led courses
- Ensure timing and delivery methods are appropriate for situation/individuals
- More economical to train current employees than hire new people who already possess skills

#### Six Sigma

- Only let high potential employees attend Six Sigma black belt training
	- Substantial investment of time/money
- Do not let employees into black belt course until employees have had potential Six Sigma project approved that relates to their current job
- Attendees can then apply new concepts/techniques learned to their jobs
- High potential employees feel rewarded
- Organization benefits by having these employees implement high-payoff projects due to training

### Team building activities

- Two common approaches
	- Physical challenges
		- ie. Military basic training
		- ie. Corporate "survivor" challenges
		- Help teams of strangers to work together more effectively
		- Can cause already dysfunctional team more problems
	- Psychological preference indicators
		- Mental building activities
		- Learn about
			- Themselves
			- Each other
			- How to work as a group most effectively
		- Common exercises
			- Myers-Briggs type indicator
			- Wilson learning social styles profile
			- DISC profile
- Important to understand when selecting team building training options
	- Individual needs
	- Learning styles
	- Past training
	- Physical limitations

	- Extrovert/introvert (EI)
		- Determines
			- If person is extroverted or introverted
			- Whether person draws energy from
				- Other people
					- Extrovert
				- Themselves

		- Sensation types take in
			- Facts
			- Details
			- Reality
			- Describes themselves as practical
		- Intuitive types
			- Imaginative
			- Ingenious
			- Attentive to hunches/intuition
			- Describe themselves as innovative/conceptual
	- Thinking/feeling (T/F)
		- Thinking judgment
			- Objective and logical
		- Feeling judgment
			- Subjective and personal
	- Judgment/perception (J/P)
		- People's attitudes towards structure
		- Judgment types
			- Like closure and task completion
			- Establish deadlines
				- Take them more seriously
				- Expect others to do the same
		- Perception types
			- Prefer to keep things open/flexible
			- Regard deadlines as a signal to rather start than complete a project
			- Do not feel work must before play/rest begins
- Benefits from knowing team member MBTI profiles
	- Project managers can adjust management style for each person
	- Ensure they have a variety of personality types on their teams
- Use with caution
	- Adopting psychological approaches without relevant qualifications and background
