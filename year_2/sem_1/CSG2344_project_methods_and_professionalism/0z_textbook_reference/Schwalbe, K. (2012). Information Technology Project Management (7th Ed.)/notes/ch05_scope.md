# Chapter 5: Scope

## What is project scope management

- Scope refers to all work involved in creating
	- Products of the project
	- Processes used to create them
- Stakeholders must agree what the products of the project are
	- How they should be produced to define deliverables
- Project scope management includes the processes involving in defining and controlling what work is or is not included in a project
	- Ensures that project team and stakeholders are on the same page about
		- What products the project will produce
		- What processes the project team will use to produce them

## Project scope management processes

1. Planning scope management
	- Determine how the project's scope and requirements will be managed
	- Output
		- Scope management plan
		- Requirements management plan
2. Collecting requirements
	- Define and document
		- Features and functions of the products
		- Process used for creating them
	- Output
		- Requirements documentation
		- Requirements traceability matrix
3. Defining scope
	- Review the following to create output
		- Scope management plan
		- Project charter
		- Requirements documents
		- Organisational process assets
	- Output
		- Project scope statement
		- Updates to project documents
4. Create WBS
	- Subdivide major deliverables into smaller components
	- Output
		- Scope baseline
			- Includes WBS / WBS dictionary
		- Updates to project documents
5. Validate scope
	- Formalize acceptance of project deliverables
	- Stakeholders inspect and formally accept deliverables
		- Or do not accept, resulting in change request
	- Output
		- Accepted deliverables
		- Change requests
		- Work performance information
		- Updates to project documents
6. Controlling scope
	- Controlling changes to project scope throughout life of project
		- Changes to scope can influence ability to meet project time / cost
		- Must analyse cost / benefits to scope changes
	- Output
		- Work performance information
		- Change request
		- Update to project management plan
		- Project documents
		- Organisational process assets

### 1: Planning scope management

- Plan how the scope will be managed throughout life of project
- Review project documents
	- Project management plan
	- Project charter
	- Enterprise environmental factors
	- Organisational process assets
- Develop outputs
	- Scope management plan
		- Subsidiary of project management plan
	- Requirements management plan

#### Scope management plan

#### Includes

- How to prepare a detailed project scope statement
	- Are there any templates or guidelines to follow
	- How much detail is needed to describe each deliverable
- How to create a WBS
	- Provide suggestions, samples, resources to create WBS
- How to maintain and approve the WBS
	- Describe guidelines for maintenance of WBS
	- Describe guidelines for WBS approval
- How to obtain formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables
- How to control requests for changes to the project scope
	- Guidelines for handling change requests for the project
		- Submitting
		- Evaluating
		- Approving

#### Requirements management plan

>**Requirement definition - 1990 IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology:**

>1. A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
2. A condition or capability that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed document
3. A documented representation of a condition or capability as in 1 or 2

>**Requirement definition - PMBOK Guide 5th Ed:**

>"Conditions or capabilities that must be met by the project or present in the product, service, or result to satisfy an agreement or other formally imposed specification...

>Requirements include the quantified and documented needs and expectations of the sponsor, customer, and other stakeholders. These requirements need to be elicited, analysed, and recorded in enough detail to be included in the scope baseline and be measured once project execution begins."

- Can divide requirements development into categories
	- Elicitation
	- Analysis
	- Specification
	- Validation
- Use an iterative approach
	- Because requirements are often unclear early in the project
- Documents how project requirements will be analysed, documented and managed

#### Includes

- How to plan, track, report requirements activities
- How to perform configuration management activities
- How to prioritize requirements
- How to use product metrics
- How to trace and capture attributes of requirements

### 2: Collecting requirements

- Major consequence of not defining requirements well
	- Rework
		- Can consume up to half of project costs
- Gather inputs from stakeholders
	- Align scope with business strategy

#### Ways to collect requirements

- Interview stakeholders
	- One on one can be effective
	- Expensive
	- Time consuming
- Focus groups / facilitated workshops
	- Uses group creativity, decision making
	- Faster
	- Less expensive than one on one
- Questionnaires / surveys
	- Can be efficient
	- Stakeholders must provide honest and thorough information
- Observation
	- Useful for projects that involve improving processes / procedures
- Prototyping / document analysis
- Context diagrams
	- Clarifies interfaces and boundaries of a project or process
- Benchmarking
	- Comparing specific project practices or product characteristics to other projects / products outside the organisation

#### Ways to document requirements

- Review
	- Project charter
		- Includes high level requirements
	- Scope / requirements management plan
	- Stakeholder register / stakeholder management plan
		- Ensure key stakeholders have input to requirements
- Break down into requirement categories
	- Functional
	- Service
	- Performance
	- Quality
	- Training

#### Requirements traceability matrix (RTM)

- Lists
	- Requirements
	- Attributes
	- Status
- Ensures that all requirements are addressed
- Can have many variations
	- Software requirements
		- Cross reference each requirement with related ones
		- Includes specific tests to very requirements are met

### 3: Defining scope

- Provide detailed definition of the work required for the project
- Good scope definition is important because it
	- Helps improve the accuracy of estimates
		- Time
		- Cost
		- Resource
	- Defines a baseline for
		- Performance measurement
		- Project control
	- Aids in communicating clear work responsibilities
- Scope will become clearer and more specific as time progresses
- Tools and techniques
	- Expert judgment
	- Product analysis
	- Alternatives generation
	- Facilitated workshops
- Input
	- Project charter
		- Provides a basis for further defining project scope
		- Describes
			- High level scope
			- Time / cost goals
			- Success criteria
			- General approach to accomplishing goals
			- Roles / responsibilities of key stakeholders
	- Scope management plan
	- Requirements documentation
	- Organisational process assets
		- ie. Policies / procedures related to scope statements
	- Previous similar project assets
		- Project files
		- Lessons learned
- Output
	- Project scope statement
	- Project document updates

#### Includes

- Project scope statement
	- Must be kept up to date
	- Develops and confirms common understanding of project scope
	- Describes in detail the work to be accomplished
	- Tool for ensuring customer satisfaction
	- Prevents scope creep
- Product scope description
- Product user acceptance criteria
- Detailed information on all project deliverables
- Other scope related information
	- Project boundaries
	- Constraints
	- Assumptions
- Reference supporting documents
	- Product specifications
		- That might affect what products are created or purchased
	- Corporate policies
		- That might affect how products or services are produced
	- IT project / software development specific
		- Detailed functional / design specifications
- Update scope as time progresses
	- Will become more detailed over time
	- Decisions and more information will affect scope
	- May require updates to other documents as well

### 4: Create WBS

- Work breakdown structure (WBS) is a deliverable oriented grouping of work involved in a project
	- Defines its total scope
- Organises and divides work into logical parts based on how the work will be performed
- WBS is a **foundation** document in project management
	- It provides the basis for planning and managing
		- Project schedules
		- Cost
		- Resources
		- Changes
- Tools and techniques
	- Decomposition
		- Subdividing project deliverables into smaller pieces
- Input
	- Project scope management plan
	- Scope statement
	- Requirements documentation
	- Enterprise environmental factors
	- Organisational process assets
- Output
	- Scope baseline
		- Includes
			- Approved project scope statement
			- WBS
			- WBS dictionary
	- Project document updates

#### What does WBS look like

- Can be in chart form
	- Visualise whole project and main parts
- Can be organised around project phases
	- Presented in tiers
	- Each tier is more specific than the previous tier
		- Decomposed
		- Decomposed tasks are called **summary tasks**
	- Each level of work called **task**
		- PMI naming convention
- WBS becomes the contents of the **task name** in MS Project
	- Hierarchy is shown by indenting and numbering tasks

#### Work packages

- A work package is a task at the lowest level of the WBS
- Work package represents the level of work that the project manager monitors and controls
- Can think of work packages in terms of accountability and reporting
	- If a project has a short time frame and requires weekly progress reports
		- A work package might represent work completed in a week or less
	- If a project has a long time frame and requires quarterly progress reports
		- A work package might represent work completed in a month or more
- Work package should be defined at the proper level so the project manager can clearly estimate the effort needed to
	- Complete it
	- Estimate cost of required resources
	- Evaluate quality of result when work package is finished
- Alternatively can think of work packages in terms of project management software
	- Estimate of work time should only be entered at work package level
	- The rest of WBS items are just groupings or summary tasks for work packages

#### To create good WBS

- Understand project and scope
- Incorporate needs and knowledge of stakeholders
- Do not confuse WBS with specification
	- WBS represents work that needs to be done to complete project
- Tasks do not have to be developed as sequential list of steps
	- Focus on
		- What work needs to be done
		- How it will be done
	- Do not focus on
		- When it will be done
- **For time based flow, organise level 2 with project management process groups**
	- Initiating
	- Planning
	- Executing
	- Monitoring
	- Controlling
	- Closing
- If project management process groups not used
	- Ensure that a project management summary task is included at level 2
		- Accounts for tasks related to managing project
- **All work should be included in WBS**
	- Including project management work
- Involve team and customer in creating and reviewing WBS
	- People who will do the work should help plan the work
	- Hold meetings to develop WBS
		- Helps everyone understand
			- What work must be done
			- How it should be done
		- Helps identify where coordination between different work packages will be required

#### Approaches to developing WBS

Several approaches:

- Using guidelines
- Analogy approach
- Top down approach
- Bottom up approach
- Mind map approach

##### Using guidelines

- Use / follow company guidelines for WBS if they exist
	- ie. DoD have own guidelines
		- Cost for entire project calculated by summing costs of all lower level WBS tasks
		- Estimate compared with contractor quotes
		- If large variation, indication that there may be confusion in what work must be done
- MS Project have templates
- PMI provides WBS Practice Standard for guidance for developing and applying WBS
	- Has sample WBS templates

##### Analogy approach

- Use similar project WBS as a starting point
	- ie. McDonnell Aircraft has preset WBS when developing aircraft

##### Top down approach

- Start with the largest items of the project
- Break them into subordinate items
- Involves refining the work int greater and greater levels of detail
- At the end, all resources should be assigned at the work package level
- Best suited to project managers who have
	- Vast technical insight
	- Big picture perspective

##### Bottom up approach

- Identify as many specific tasks related to project as possible
	- Group into categories
	- Group categories into higher level categories
	- Repeat
- Can be time consuming
	- But also effective
- Use bottom up approach for projects that represent entirely new systems or approaches to doing a job
	- Also helps create buy-in and synergy with team

##### Mind map approach

- Can be used for top down or bottom up
- Ideas written down in non linear fashion
- MS Project supports mind map import
	- WBS structure generted automatically

#### WBS dictionary

- Document that provides detailed information about each WBS item
- Can also include
	- Responsible person / organisation
	- Resource requirements
	- Estimated costs
	- Other info
- Defines the work involved in a task
	- Clarification that makes the summary description in the WBS easier to understand in terms of approach taken to complete the work
	- Not a glossary or dictionary in classic sense
- Work with team / sponsor to determine level of detail needed for WBS dictionary

##### Advice for creating WBS / WBS dictionary

- Requires several iterations
- A unit of work should appear at only one place in the WBS
- Work content of a WBS item is the sum of the WBS items below it
- A WBS item is the responsibility of only one person
	- Even though many people might be working on it
- WBS must be consistent with the way work will actually be performed
	- It should serve the project team first
	- Then serve other purposes only if practical
- Project team members should be involved in developing the WBS to ensure consistency and buy in
- Each WBS item must be documented in a WBS dictionary to ensure accurate understanding of the scope of work included and not included in that item
- The WBS must be a flexible tool to accommodate inevitable changes while properly maintaining control of the work content in the project according to the scope statement

### 5: Validating scope

- Scope validation involves formal acceptance of the completed project deliverables
	- Often achieved by a customer inspection then sign off on key deliverables
	- Must develop clear documentation of the project's products and procedures to evaluate whether they were completed correctly and satisfactorily
- Input
	- Scope management plan
	- Scope baseline
	- Requirements documentation
	- Requirements traceability matrix
	- Validated deliverables
	- Work performance data
- Tools
	- Inspection
	- Group decision making techniques
- Output
	- Accepted deliverables
	- Change requests
	- Work performance information
	- Project document updates

### 6: Controlling scope

- Involves managing changes to the project scope
	- While keeping project goals and business strategy in mind
- Goals of scope control
	- Influence factors that cause scope changes
	- Ensure changes are processed according to procedures developed as part of integrated change control
	- Manage changes when they occur
- Need to develop a process for soliciting and monitoring changes to project scope
	- Stakeholders should be encouraged to suggest changes that will benefit the overall project
		- Discouraged from suggesting unnecessary changes
- Input
	- Project management plan
	- Requirements documentation
	- Requirements traceability matrix
	- Work performance data
	- Organisational process assets
- Tools
	- Variance analysis
		- Variance is the difference between planned and actual performance
- Output
	- Work performance information
	- Change requests
	- Project management plan updates
	- Project documents updates
	- Organisational process assets updates

#### Improving user input

- Develop good project selection process
	- Insist all projects have a sponsor from the user organisation
		- Sponsor should not work in IT department
		- Sponsor should not be the project manager
	- Project information below should be made easily available
		- Project charter
		- Project management plan
		- Project scope statement
		- WBS / WBS dictionary
- Have users on the project team
- Have regular meetings
	- Give / receive direct feedback
	- Have users sign off on key deliverables presented at meetings
- Deliver something to project users and sponsors on regular basis
	- Make sure it works first
- Do not promise to deliver something impossible
	- Ensure it can be done within time frame
	- Make sure project schedule allows enough time to produce deliverables
- Locate users with developers
	- If not possible, set aside certain days to work in same location

## Reducing incomplete / changing requirements

- Develop and follow a requirements management process that includes procedures for determining initial requirements
- Employ techniques below to understand user requirements thoroughly
- Prototyping
	- Develop a working replica of the system or some aspect of the system
	- Effective tool for
		- Gaining understanding of requirements
		- Determining feasibility of requirements
		- Resolving user interface uncertainties
- Use case modeling
	- Process for identifying and modeling business events
		- Who initiated them
		- How the system should respond to them
	- Effective tool for
		- Understanding requirements of information systems
- Joint application design (JAD)
	- Highly organised and intensive workshops to bring people together to jointly define and design information systems
		- Stakeholders
		- Sponsors
		- Users
		- Business analysts
		- Programmers
		- etc.
	- Help users become more active in defining system requirements
- Put all requirements in writing and keep them current and readily available
	- ie. Requirements management tool
- Create requirements management database for documenting and controlling requirements
	- Computer aided software enginering (CASE) tools can assist in maintaining a repository for project data
- Provide adequate testing to verify the project's products perform as expected
	- Conduct testing throughout project lifecycle
- Use a process for reviewing requested requirements changes from a systems perspective
	- Ensure that project scope changes inlcude associated cost / schedule changes
	- Require approval by appropriate stakeholders
- Emphasise completion dates
	- Use as bargaining tool when users want a change
	- "What do you want to give up to get it?"
- Allocate resources specifically for handling change requests
	- ie. Set up place for users to submit change requests
		- Full time programmers to process change requests

## Scope best practices

1. Keep scope realistic
	- Don't make projects so large that they can't be completed
	- Break large projects down into a series of smaller ones
2. Involve users in project scope management
	- Assign key users to the project team
		- Give them ownership of
			- Requirements definition
			- Scope validation
3. Use off the shelf hardware / software when possible
	- New technologies introduce risk
	- If technology features / functions do not balance risk, avoid and use trusted technologies from prior experience
4. Follow good project management practices

### IBM Rational Unified Process (RUP)

1. Adapt the process
2. Balance competing stakeholder priorities
3. Collaborate across teams
4. Demonstrate value iteratively
5. Elevate the level of abstraction
6. Focus continuously on quality
