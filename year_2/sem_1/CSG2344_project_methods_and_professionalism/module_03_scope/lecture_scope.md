# Project planning

- Planning is often the most difficult and unappreciated process in project management
- Often, people do not want to take the time to plan well
	- But theory and practice show that good planning is crucial to good execution
- **The main purpose** of project planning is to guide project execution
	- So project plans **must be realistic and useful**

## Project integration management planning tasks

- **Project integration management** involves coordinating all the project management knowledge areas throughout a project's life span
- Main planning tasks include:
	- Creating a team contract
	- Developing the project management plan

## Team contracts

- **Team contracts help promote teamwork and clarify team communications**
- The process normally includes the core project team members working in small groups to prepare inputs for their team contract
- The project manager should act as a coach
	- Observing the different personalities of team members and seeing who works well together
- Everyone involved in creating the team contract should sign it
	- As new team members are added, the project manager should review ground rules with them and have them read and sign the contract as well

### Topics covered in a team contract

- Code of conduct
- Participation
- Communication
- Problem solving
- Meeting guidelines
- Information sharing
- Conflict resolution

## Project management plans

- A **project management plan** is a document used to coordinate all project planning documents and to help guide a project's execution and control
- Plans created in the other knowledge areas are subsidiary parts of the overall project management plan and provide more detailed information about that knowledge area

### Topics covered in a project management plan

- Introduction / overview of the project
- Management and technical processes
- Project organisation
- Work to be performed
- Schedule information
- Budget information
- Other planning documents
	- Scope
	- Time
	- Cost
	- Quality
	- Risk
	- HR
	- Communications
	- Procurement

## Project scope management

- Project scope management is primarily concerned with defining and controlling what is and what is not included in the project
- It ensures that the project team and stakeholders all have a clear understanding of the project deliverables and the processes used to produce them

### 10 Knowledge areas

1. Scope
2. Time
3. Cost
4. Quality
5. Communications
6. Risk
7. Human resources
8. Procurement
9. Stakeholders
10. Integration

### Scope management processes

- **Scope planning**
	- Documentation detailing how the other four processes will be created and defined
- **Scope definition**
	- Develops a detailed project scope statement
- **Creating the WBS**
	- A deliverable-oriented breakdown of the total project scope
- **Scope verification**
	- Formalised acceptance of the completed project deliverables
- **Scoe control**
	- Controlling changes to the project scope

### Scope management planning

- The main documents produced are
	- Scope management plan
	- Scope statement
	- WBS
	- WBS dictionary

### Scope planning and the scope management plan

- A project's size, complexity, importance as well as other factors affect how much effort is spent on scope planning
- A **scope management plan** describes how the team will
	- Prepare the scope statement
	- Create the WBS
	- Verify completion of the project deliverables
	- Control requests for changes to the project scope

### The scope statement

- The preliminary project scope statement should provide basic scope information
	- And subsequent scope statements should clarify and provide more specific information
- Work that is **not** included in the scope statement **should not be done**

### Work breakdown structrue (WBS)

- WBS is used to plan in detail exactly what needs to be done by the project team through the defining and structuring of all the deliverables needed to produce the project's end products or manage the project
- It is concerned with the **what** of the project
	- Not the how, when how much or who etc.
	- It answers **what is to be delivered**

#### What is WBS?

- Creating the WBS is the process of organising and subdividing the major project deliverables and project work into smaller, manageable components of work
	- Allows for clear and comprehensive groupings of the deliverables which at their lowest lever area called **work packages**
- The WBS is a foundation document in project management because it provides the basis for:
	- Planning and managing project schedules
	- Costs
	- Resources
	- Changes
- Often shown in two different forms:
	- Chart
	- Tabular

![wbs & schedule example](http://snag.gy/znkMS.jpg)

#### Work breakdown

![work breakdown](http://snag.gy/oAMVN.jpg)

#### WBS and work package concept

- The WBS should follow the work package concept

![wbs work package](http://snag.gy/OxFKG.jpg)

#### Work packages

- A **work package** is a task at the lowest level of the WBS
- It represents the level of work that the project manager monitors and controls
- Think of work packages **in terms of accountability**
	- If a project has a relatively short time frame and requires weekly progress reports
		- A work package might represent work completed in one week or less
	- If a project has a very long time frame and requires quarterly progress reports
		- A work package might represent work completed in one month or more

#### Deliverables and milestones

- Deliverables
	- Tangible, verifiable work products
		- Reports
		- Presentations
		- Prototypes
- Milestones
	- Significant events or achievements
	- Acceptance of deliverables or phase completion
	- Cruxes
		- Proof of concepts
	- Quality control
	- Keeps team focused

#### Inputs to WBS

- Organisational guidelines
	- Policies and lessons learned reports from previous projects
- Preliminary scope statement
	- From project initialisation
- Project scope management plan
	- Details how the project scope will be defined and verified
	- Defines how the WBS will be created
- Approved change requests
	- During the lifetime of a project, changes will be requested
		- These can impact
			- Project scope
			- Quality
			- Costs
			- Time
	- They need to go through the **integrated change control process** before being added to the **project scope statement**

### Approaches to developing WBS

- Analogy approach
	- Review WBS of similar projects and tailor to your project
- Top down approach
	- Start with the largest items of the project and break them down
- Bottom up approach
	- Start with the specific tasks and roll them up
- Mind mapping approach
	- Write tasks in a non-linear, branching format then create the WBS structure

![mind map example](http://snag.gy/4j51v.jpg)

#### Advice for creating a WBS and WBS dictionary

- A unit of work should appear only once in the WBS
- The work content of a WBS item is the sum of the WBS items below it
- The WBS must be consistent with the way in which work is actually going to be performed
	- It should serve the project team first
	- Then serve other purposes only if practical
- Project team members should be involved in developing the WBS to ensure consistency and buy-in
- Each WBS item must be documented in a WBS dictionary to ensure accurate understanding of the scope of work that is included and not included in that item
- The WBS must be a flexible tool to accommodate inevitable changes while maintaining control of the work content based on the scope management

#### Creating a good WBS

- It is difficult to create a good WBS
- The project manager and the project team must decide as a group how to organise the work
	- And how many levels to include in the WBS
- It is often better to focus on getting the top levels of the WBS done well to avoid being distracted by too much detail
- Many people confuse tasks on a WBS with specifications or think it must reflect a sequential list of steps

#### Creating the WBS dictionary

- A **WBS dictionary** is a document that **describes each WBS task in detail**
- The format can vary based on project needs
	- It might be appropriate to have just a short paragraph describing each work package
	- For a more complex project, an entire page or more might be needed for the work package descriptions
	- It might require describing
		- The responsible person / organisation
		- Resource requirements
		- Estimated costs
		- Other information

# Scope management

## Poor scope causes failures

>Without a doubt, the most common reason that projects fail is because of poor scope definition. By that I mean that the expectations of the stakeholders, and especially the client or sponsor, are different than the expectations of the project team.

>This is a most difficult problem, but it is critical to the success of the project that it is overcome.

### An example to consider

- Once you have developed a WBS and WBS dictionary, how do you know that it meets **all useer expectations**?
- Example for discussion
	- Your company has decided it wants to run in-house training for common training needs such as negotiation skills
		- Instead of sending staff on courses, this is to be available from an intranet
		- Benefits include just-in-time and significant reduction in costs
			- Course fees
			- Hotel bills
			- etc.

#### Some answers

- **Users** might like to get away from the job for a few days and are negative about online training
- **Online training** not good for developing interactive skills such as negotiation
- **Management** expects a reduction in cost but assumes that quality of experience will be the same
	- When it turns out that users don't like it, they blame IT
- An expectation is not the same as a set of deliverables
	- Expectations are met when a set of deliverables provide what management and users expect
	- But how do you guarantee that will happen when all you can show users initially is a WBS and a dictionary?

## Scope baseline

- The approved project scope statement and its associated WBS and WBS dictionary form the **scope baseline**
- A **baseline** is a starting point, a measurement, or an observation that is documented so that it can be used for future comparison
- Performance in meeting project scope goals is based on how close you are to the scope baseline

## Scope control

- **Scope control** involves controlling changes to the project scope
- Goals of scope control are to
	- Ensure changes are processed according to procedures
	- Manage changes when they occur
- **Variance** is the difference between the planned and actual performance

## Scope creep

- **Scope creep occurs in almost every project**
	- The key is to limit the amount of scope creep
- Scope creep:
	- Increases the risk of project failure
	- Affects cost
		- Which affects bonuses
	- Hurts team morale
		- It places change at random, unexpected moments
	- Can be personal
		- ie. Sponsor's pet project
	- Is the major cause of projects **becoming operations**

### Identifying scope creep

- Anything additional that will affect time will almost always have an additional cost
- Scope creep often sounds like an addition that is going to be wonderful
	- But the change should never prevent you from completing the original project scope

## How to reduce incomplete and changing requirements

- Develop and follow a requirements management process
- Use the following techniques to get more user involvement
	- Prototyping
	- Use case modeling
- Put requirements in writing and keep them current
- Allocate resources specifically for handling change requests and enhancements

## How to improve user input

- Develop a good project selection process and insist that all sponsors are from the user organisation
- Place users on the project team in important roles
- Hold regular meetings with defined agendas
	- Have users sign off on key deliverables presented at meetings
- Deliver something to users / sponsors on a regular basis
- Don't promise to deliver when you know you can't
- Co-locate users with developers
