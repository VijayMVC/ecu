# Outsourcing

## Debates on outsourcing

- Some companies such as WalMart prefer to not outsource at all
	- Others do a lot of outsourcing
- Most organizations do some form of outsourcing to meet their IT needs

	- Obligates buyer to pay for them
- Can clarify responsibilities
	- Sharpen focus on key deliverables of project
- More accountability for delivering work as stated in contract
	- Because legally binding
- Recent trend in outsourcing is increasing size of contracts

## What went wrong

- Companies often change their minds about procurement
- JP Morgan Chase announced seven year, $5B deal to outsource data processing to IBM
	- Revoked contract in less than two years
	- Procurement plan no longer fit their business strategy
- Australian Computer Society (ACS) says sending work offshore may
	- Lower number of students entering IT courses
	- Deplete number of skilled IT professionals
	- Diminish nation's strategic technology capability
- Procurement can also cause security problems
	- Protection of intellectual property
	- Integrity of data
	- Reliability of infrastructure in offshore locations

# Project procurement management processes

- Acquiring goods/services for a project outside performing organization

![summary](http://snag.gy/Y4lBC.jpg)

## Planning purchases/acquisitions

- Determine procurement
	- What
	- When
	- How
- Identify which project needs can best be met by using products/services outside the organization
	- Sometimes there is no need to buy any products/services externally

## Planning contracting

- Describe requirements for products/services desired from procurement
- Identify potential sources/sellers who provide goods/services to other organizations
	- Contractors
	- Suppliers
	- Providers

## Requesting seller responses

- Obtaining from sellers as appropriate
	- Information
	- Quotes
	- Bids
	- Offers
	- Proposals

## Selecting sellers

- Choosing from among potential suppliers
	- Process of evaluating potential sellers
	- Negotiate contracts

## Administering contract

- Managing the relationship with selected seller

## Closing contract

- Completing/settling each contract
	- Resolve open items

## What went right?

- Several companies such as The Boots Company PLC in England
	- Outsource IT services to save money compared with the cost of running the systems themselves
- Careful planning procurement can also save millions of dollars
	- US Airforce
		- Using unit price strategy for large office automation project

# Tools/techniques for planning purchases/acquisitions

## Make or buy analysis

- General management technique to determine whether an organization should make or perform particular product/service
	- Within organization
	- Purchase externally
- Often involves financial analysis
- Internal/external experts can provide valuable input in procurement decisions

### Make or buy example

- Assume, for an item the project requires
	- $800 p/day lease
	- $12,000 purchase
		- $400 operational cost p/day
- How long will it take for the purchase cost to be the same as the lease cost?

### Make or buy solution

- Set up an equation so both options, purchase/lease are equal
- In this example, using the following equation
	- Let d be the number of days to use the item

>$12,000 + $400 \* (d) = $800 \* (d)  
Subtract $400 \* (d) from both sides  
= $12,000 = $400(d)  
Divide both sides by $400(d)  
= d = 30

- If you need the item for more than 30 days
	- It is more economical to purchase it

# Contracts

## Types of contracts

- Different types of contracts can be used in different situations
- **Fixed price/lump sum**
	- Involve a fixed total price for well defined product or service
- **Cost reimbursable**
	- Involve payment to seller for direct/indirect costs
- **Time/material**
	- Hybrid of fixed price and cost reimbursable contracts
	- Often used by consultants
- **Unit price**
	- Require the buyer to pay the seller a predetermined amount per unit of service
- A single contract can actually include all four of these categories
	- If it makes sense for that particular procurement

### Cost reimbursable contracts

- **Cost plus incentive fee (CIPF)**
	- Buyer pays supplier for allowable performance costs
	- Plus predetermined fee and an incentive bonus
- **Cost plus fixed fee (CPFF)**
	- Buyer pays supplier for allowable performance costs
	- Plus a fixed fee payment usually based on percentage of estimated costs
- **Cost plus percentage of costs (CPCC)**
	- Buyer pays supplier for allowable performance costs
	- Plus predetermined percentage based on total costs

## Contract types vs. Risk

![contract types vs. risk](http://snag.gy/ARwW0.jpg)

## Contract clauses

- Contracts should include specific clauses to take into account issues unique to the project
- Can require various educational or work experience for different pay rights
- A **termination clause** is a contract clause that allows the buyer or supplier to end the contract

# Procurement management plan

- Describes how the procurement process will be managed
	- From developing documentation for making purchases/acquisitions
	- To contract closure
- Content varies based on project needs

## Contract statement of work (SOW)

- A **statement of work** is a description of the work required for the procurement
- If a SOW is used as a part of a contract to describe only the work required for that particular contract
	- It is called a **contract statement of work**
- A SOW is a type of scope statement
- A good SOW gives bidders a better understanding of the buyer's expectations

### Statement of work (SOW) template

- **Request for proposals**
	- Used to solicit proposals from prospective sellers
		- A **proposal** is a document prepared by a seller when there are different approaches for meeting buyer needs
- **Request for quotes**
	- Used to solicit quotes or bids from prospective suppliers
		- A **bid**, also called tender or quote
			- Is a document prepared by sellers providing pricing standard items that have been clearly defined by the buyer

## Request for proposal (RFP) template

![RFP template](http://snag.gy/f65KL.jpg)

## Evaluation criteria

	- Preferably before issuing formal RFP or RFQ
- Beware of proposals that look good on paper
	- Be sure to evaluate factors
		- Past performance
		- Management approach

### Detailed criteria for selecting suppliers

![detailed criteria for selecting suppliers](http://snag.gy/4wBBh.jpg)

## Seller selection process

- Organizations often do an initial evaluation of all proposals and bids
	- Then develop a short list of potential sellers for further evaluation
- Sellers on the short list often prepare a best and final offer (BAFO)
- Final output is a contract signed by the buyer and the selected seller

## Administering the contract

- Ensures that the seller's performance meets contractual requirements
- Contracts are legal relationships
	- Important that legal and contract professionals be involved in writing/administering contracts
- It is crucial that project managers/team members watch for **constructive change orders**
	- Oral/written acts/omissions by someone with actual or apparent authority that can be construed to have the same effect as a written change order

## Suggestions for change control in contracts

- Changes to any part of the project needs to be reviewed/approved/documented by same people in same way that original part of the plan was approved
- Evaluation of any change should include an impact analysis
	- How will the change affect goods/services being provided
		- Scope
		- Time
		- Cost
		- Quality
- Changes must be documented in writing
	- Project team members should also document all important meetings/telephone calls
- Project managers/teams should stay closely involved to make sure the new system will meet business needs
	- Work in an operational environment
- Have backup plans
- Use tools/techniques
	- Contract change control system
	- Buyer conducted performance reviews
	- Inspection/audits
	- etc.

## Closing the contract

- Involves completing/settling contracts and resolving open items
- Project team should
	- Determine if all work was completed
		- Correctly
		- Satisfactorily
	- Update records to reflect final results
	- Archive information for future use
- Contract itself should include requirements for formal acceptance and closure

### Tools to assist in contract closure

- Procurement audits identify lessons learned in procurement process
- Records management system provides ability to easily manage procurement related documents
	- Organize
	- Find
	- Archive
