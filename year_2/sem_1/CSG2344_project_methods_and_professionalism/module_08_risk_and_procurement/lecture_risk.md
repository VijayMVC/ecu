# Risk

## Objectives

- Risk identification
- Risk quantification and estimation
- Risk evaluation and prioritization
- Risk mitigation
- Risk monitoring and control

## Importance of project risk management

- Art and science of considering
	- What risks could disrupt the project
	- What effect would they have
	- What can be done about them
- Throughout the life of a project
- In the best interests of meeting project objectives

## Benefits of risk management

- Allows for proactive management
	- Not reactive
- Consistent and systematic view of problem domain
- Improved credibility of plans
	- Provides justification for decisions made
- Provides a feedback mechanism to prevent/avoid risks
- A means to identify opportunities
- Confidence in decision making

# Risk management

- To expose the chance of injury or loss
- Concerned with the future
- Involves a level of uncertainty

## Risk vs. problems

- A problem is not a risk
- It is a risk that has occurred

# Risk management types

## Reactive

- Mitigation of symptoms
- Fix on failure
- Crisis management

## Proactive

- Elimination of error and root causes
- Anticipation of failure
- Management of change

## Risk principle

>If you don't actively attack the risks, they will actively attack you

## Risk questions

- What are the risks?
- What is the probability of loss from them?
- How much are the losses likely to cost?
- What might the losses be in worst case scenario?
- What alternatives are there?
- How can the losses be reduced or eliminated?
- Will the alternatives produce other risks?

# Risk management process

![risk management process](http://snag.gy/2MqCX.jpg)

## Risk identification

- Process of understanding what potential events might hurt or enhance a particular project
- Risk identification tools and techniques
	- Brainstorming
	- Delphi technique
	- Interviewing
	- SWOT analysis
	- Ishikawa diagram
	- Review previous projects
		- Lessons learned reports

### Brainstorming

- Group attempts to generate ideas or find a solution for specific problem
	- Amassing ideas spontaneously without judgment
- Experienced facilitator should run session
- Be careful not to misuse brainstorming
	- Group effects can inhibit idea generation

### Delphi technique

- Used to derive a consensus among a panel of experts who make predictions about future developments
- Provides independent and anonymous input regarding future events
- Uses repeated rounds of questioning/written responses
	- Avoids biasing effects from oral methods
		- ie. Brainstorming

### Interviewing

- Fact finding technique for collecting information during discussions
	- Face to face
	- Phone
	- Email
	- Instant messaging
- Interviewing people with similar project experience is an important tool for identifying potential risks

### SWOT analysis

- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Opportunities
- Threats
- Helps identify the broad risks that apply to a project

### Ishikawa diagram

![ishikawa diagram](http://snag.gy/L3pcV.jpg)

### Risk breakdown structure

- A hierarchy of potential risk categories for a project
- Similar to a WBS but used to identify/categorize risks

## Potential areas of risk

- Technical
- Organizational
- Project management
- Users
- Installation issues
- Operations and support

## Risk estimation and quantification

- Probability of risk occurrence
	- Nominate scale
		- High
		- Medium
		- Low
- Impact of risk occurrence
	- (Probability) * (cost if risk occurs)
	- Or nominate a scale as above
- Each risk item classified according to probability of occurrence on a scale
	- ie. 0 to 1
	- Or low to high
- Project impact of each item assessed in financial terms

>("Risk") (Probability) \* (impact) = (expected cost)  
>"Risk name" 0.1 \* $20,000 = $2,000

### Probability matrix

## Risk mitigation response planning

- After identifying/quantifying risks
	- Must decide how to respond to them
- Main response strategies for negative risks
	- Risk acceptance
	- Risk mitigation
		- Clearly defined strategies to avert high priority risks from occurring

### Risk register

- Main output of risk identification process is a list of identified risks and other information needed to begin creating a risk register
- Risk register is
	- A document that contains results of various risk management processes
	- Often displayed in a table/spreadsheet format
	- A tool for documenting potential risk events and related information
- Risk events
	- Refer to specific, uncertain events that may occur to the detriment/enchancement of project

#### Risk register contents

- Risk event ID number
- Risk event rank
- Risk event name
- Risk event description
- Risk event category
- Risk event root cause
- Risk event trigger
	- Indicators/symptoms of actual risk events
- Potential responses to each risk
- Risk owner
	- Who will take responsibility for risk
- Risk event probability
- Risk event impact
- Risk event status

## Risk monitoring and controlling

### Top 10 risk item tracking

- Helps identify current risks
- Maintains awareness of risks throughout lifecycle
- Establish a periodic review of top 10 project risk items
- List
	- Current ranking
	- Previous ranking
	- Number of times the risk appears on the list over a period of time
	- Summary of progress made in resolving risk item

#### Risk tracking example

## Risk management planning

- Output
	- Risk management plan
	- Documents procedures for managing risk throughout a project
- Project team should review project documents
	- Understand organization/sponsor's approaches to risk
- Level of detail will vary with needs of the project

### Topics addressed in risk management plan

- Methodology
- Roles/responsibilities
- Risk categories
- Risk probability/impact
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Risk documentation requirements

### Results of good project risk management

- Unlike crisis management
	- Good project risk management often goes unnoticed
- Well run projects appear to be almost effortless
	- Lot of work goes into running a project
- Project managers should strive to make their jobs look easy to reflect the results of well run projects

## Costs of risk management

- Implementation of risk management system
- Training of staff
- Time taken to perform risk management work

# Summary

- Project risk management
	- Art and science of
		- Identifying
		- Analyzing
		- Responding to risk
	- Throughout project lifecycle
		- In best interests of meeting project objectives
