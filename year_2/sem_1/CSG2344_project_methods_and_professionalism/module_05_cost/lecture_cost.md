# Cost

## Objectives

- Project cost management is traditionally a weak area in IT projects
	- Project managers must work to improve their ability to deliver projects within approved budgets
- Main processes include
	- Cost estimating
	- Cost budgeting
	- Cost control

## Importance of project cost management

- IT projects have poor track record for meeting budget goals
- Since 2003, CHAOS studies have showed the average cost **overrun** on IT products
	- Ranging from 40% - 48% every year

## What is cost and project cost management?

- **Cost**
	- A resource sacrificed or foregone to achieve a specific objective
	- Or something given up in exchange
- Costs are usually measured in monetary units like dollars
- **Project cost management**
	- Includes the processes required to ensure that the project is completed within an approved budget

## Project cost management processes

- Cost estimating
	- Developing an approximation or estimate of the costs of the resources needed to complete a project
- Cost budgeting
	- Allocating the overall cost estimate to individual work items to establish a baseline for measuring performance
- Cost control
	- Controlling changes to the project budget

## Causes of estimation error

- Incorrectly estimating
	- Project scope
	- Stakeholders' effort
	- Quality
	- Project risk
- Forgetting tasks
- Misunderstanding your people
- Estimation is politics
	- The **low** bid
	- The **buy the project** bid
- Most estimation errors occur before you even estimate

## Basic principles of cost management

- Most members of an executive board have a better understanding and are more interested in financial terms than IT terms
	- So IT project managers must speak their language

## Example: Cost of software defects

- It is important to spend money upfront on IT projects to avoid spending a lot more later

## Cost estimating

- Project managers must take cost estimates seriously if they want to complete projects within budget constraints
- It's important to know
	- The types of cost estimates
	- How to prepare cost estimates
	- Typical problems associated with IT cost estimates

## Resource planning

- Some questions to consider
	- How difficult will it be to do specific tasks on this project
	- Is there anything unique in this project's scope statement that will affect resources
	- What is the duration
		- Annual pay increases
		- Contractor rate reviews
	- What is the organisation's history in doing similar tasks
	- Does the organisation have or can they acquire the following that are capable and available for performing the work
		- People
		- Equipment
		- Materials
	- What alternatives are there
		- Outsourcing
		- Contractors vs. permanent staff
			- Contractors may cost more than staff in long term

## Cost estimation considerations

- Most significant cost of most IT projects are labour costs
- There are costs associated with the use of end users
- In most projects there will be a need for
	- Varied skills, experience and other resources
- Producing project cost estimates requires
	- Time
	- Effort
	- Commitment from **all** stakeholders

## Types of cost estimates

- Often the best estimate is no estimate
- Particularly if you suspect the wrong use is to be made of the estimate

### Rough order of magnitude (ROM)

- A rough idea of what the project will cost
- Large range of accuracy or inaccuracy
- Dangerous basis for decision making

### Budgetary estimate

- Used to allocate money into an organisation's budget
- Usually more accurate
- Not always inclusive of all costs depending on budget policies

### Definitive estimate

- Accurate estimate
- Used for decision making
- Inclusive of **all** project costs

## Estimation principles

- Avoid single person estimation
- Always complete a risk assessment prior to estimation
- Where possible use relevant experts
- Always carefully document estimating assumptions
- Review the work breakdown structure (WBS)
- Always undertake sensitivity analysis
- Beware the estimation ambush

## Other costs to be considered

- Direct costs
	- Labour
	- Materials
	- Equipment
	- Facilities
- Indirect costs
	- Apportioned costs
		- ie. Administration contribution
- Sunk costs
	- Costs already incurred
- Learning curve
	- Time lost on learning new technologies required of the project
- Contingency
	- A reserve in case something goes wrong
	- Or based on risk assessment

## Cost estimation tools and techniques

- 3 basic tools and techniques for cost estimates
	- **Analogous / top down:**
		- Use the actual cost of a previous, similar project as the basis for the new estimate
	- **Bottom up:**
		- Estimate individual work items and sum them together to get a total estimate
	- **Parametric:**
		- Use project characteristics in a mathematical model to estimate costs

### Top down estimating

- Uses the cost of previous similar projects
- Requires a good deal of expert judgement to understand where similarities and variations exist
- Less costly to do
- Less accurate
- Relies on similarity of projects
- Unless similarities are real and not perceived
	- Will lead to underestimation of cost

### Bottom up estimating

- Involves estimating individual work items and summing to get total project cost
- Size of individual work items and skill of estimators drives the accuracy
	- The smaller the work item, the more accurate the estimates are likely to be
- It is time consuming and therefore costly to undertake
- Often too focused on effort rather than duration

### Parametric modelling

- Uses parameters for mathematical modelling
- Parameters include
	- Estimated lines of code
	- Function points
	- Corporate cost parameters
		- ie. Person cost of $10,000 per month
- Relies on historical data

## Guesstimating using delphi techniques

- **Provide team members with the required information**
	- Review the project risk and WBS
- **Individual estimation**
	- Each person provides
		- Best case
		- Worst case
		- Likely case
	- Review first cut estimates
	- Undertake delphi analysis
		- Group discussions
		- Issues considered
		- Assumptions
- Adjust estimates and discard outliers
- Final reality check

## Cost management plan

- A cost management plan is a document that describes how the organisation will manage cost variances on the project
- A large percentage of total projecft costs are often labour costs
	- So project managers must develop and track estimates for labour

## Typical problems with IT cost estimates

- Developing an estimate for a large software project is a complex task that requires a significant amount of effort
- People who develop estimates often do not have sufficient experience or historical data
- Human beings are biased towards underestimation
- Management might ask for an estimate
	- But really desire to win a major contract or get internal funding

## Cost budgeting

- Cost budgeting involves allocating the project cost estimate to individual work items over time
- The WBS is a required input for the cost budgeting process because it defines the work items
- Important goal is to produce a **cost baseline:**
	- A time phased budget that project managers use to measure and monitor cost performance

## Cost control

- Project cost control includes
	- Monitoring cost performance
	- Ensuring that only appropriate project changes are included in a revised cost baseline
	- Informing project stakeholders of authorized changes to the project that will affect costs
- Many organisations around the globe have problems with cost control

## Earned value management (EVM)

- EVM is a project performance measurement technique that integrates the following data
	- Scope
	- Time
	- Cost
- Given a baseline, you can determine how well the project is meeting its goals
	- Original plan plus approved changes
- You must enter actual information periodically to use EVM
- More and more organisations around the world are using EVM to help control project costs
- EVM represents the amount of the budget we really should have spent for the amount of work completed so far
- **In general terms**
	- If the EV is greater than te actual cost, we are in good shape
		- ie. We have spent less to achieve more
	- If the EV is less than the actual cost, we have spent more to achieve less
		- ie. We are not in good shape

### Earned value considerations

- To calculate EV you need to know
	- What you had planned to complete by the calculation date
		- Cost estimates by task
		- An accurate time schedule for each task
	- The percentage complete of each task being included in the calculation
		- Often it is easier to work out how much time is still required to complete a task rather than how much has been completed
		- Beware the 90% complete syndrome

### Earned value management terms

- **Planned value (PV):**
	- Formerly called Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS)
		- ie. Budget
	- The approved total cost estimate planned to be spent during a given period
- **Actual cost (AC):**
	- Also called Actual Cost of Work Performed (ACWP)
	- The total of direct and indirect costs incurred in accomplishing work on an activity during a given period
- **Earned value (EV)**
	- Formerly called Budgeted Cost of Work Performed (BCWP)
	- An estimate of the value of the physical work actually completed
- EV is based on the original planned costs for the project and the rate the team is completing work on the project to date

## Rate of performance (RP)

- The ratio of actual work completed to the percentage of work planned to have been completed at any given time during the life of the project or activity
- Example
	- Suppose the server installation was halfway completed by the end of week 1
	- The rate of performance would be 50% because by the end of week 1, the planned schedule reflects that the task should be 100% complete
		- Yet only 50% of the work has actually been completed

## Software to assist in cost management

- Spreadsheets are a common tool for
	- Resource planning
	- Cost estimating
	- Cost budgeting
	- Cost control
- Many companies use more sophisticated and centralized financial application software for cost information
- MS Project has many cost related reports
	- Cash flow
	- Budget
	- Over budget tasks

## Summary

- Project cost management is weak area in IT projects
- Main processes include
	- Cost estimating
	- Cost budgeting
	- Cost control
