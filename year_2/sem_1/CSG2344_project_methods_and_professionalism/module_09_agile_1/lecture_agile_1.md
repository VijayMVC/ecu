# Agile part 1

## Traditional vs. agile

1. Traditional project management treats scope as king
	- Anything outside scope is ignored
	- Actively try to retain project with the same scope
2. Agile sees change as good
	- Looks to develop scope as project proceeds
3. Agile uses **MoSCoW** principle

## MoSCoW

- Must have
- Should have
- Could have
- Wont have
	- Right now

## 8 agile project principles

1. Focus on business need
2. Deliver on time
3. Collaborate
4. Never compromise quality
5. Build incrementally from firm foundations
6. Develop iteratively
7. Communicate continuously and clearly
8. Demonstrate control

### Focus on business need

- Decisions are based around project goals
	- Not wants
- Clear understanding of business priorities
	- MoSCoW rules
- Guarantee **minimum usable subset**
	- MUST haves
- Supported by business roles and agreed products

### Deliver on time

- Team must timebox the work
- Deliver according to MoSCoW
- Never move the agreed timeline

### Collaborate

- Involve the right stakeholders at the right time
	- Throughout the project
- Team members are empowered to make decisions
- Actively involve business representatives
- Hold facilitator workshops

### Never compromise quality

- Fit for purpose
- Team must set/agree acceptance criteria
- Ensure quality does not become variable
- Design, document, test
- Test early and often
- Constant review by the right people

### Build incrementally from firm foundations

- BIFO
- Team must strive for early delivery of business benefit where possible
- Continually confirm that the correct solution is being built
- Formally reassess MoSCoW and on going project viability at each timebox

### Develop iteratively

- Nothing is ever built perfectly the first time
- Enough design up front (EDUF)
	- Do just enough design to be able to make something that can be shown
- Embrace and expect change
- Agile knows that change is inevitable
	- Harness the benefits

### Communicate continuously and clearly

- Team must
	- Run daily stand up sessions
	- Use facilitated workshops
	- Model and prototype
	- Keep documentation
		- Lean and timely
	- Have face to face communication at all levels of stakeholder engagement

### Demonstrate control

- Team must
	- Guarantee timeboxing
	- Use burn down charts
	- Track velocity
	- Use technical expertise

## Agile roles

- Business sponsor
	- Project champion
	- Takes risks
- Business visionary
	- Provides strategic direction
	- Guarantees that the business needs are on track
		- ie. Business case
- Project manager
	- Focus on delivery
	- Communicates with senior management
- Technical coordinator
	- Has technical authority for the project
- Business analyst
	- Links solution development team with senior management
- Solution development team
	- Builds the timeboxes
	- Executes the work
- Team leader
	- Leads solution development team
	- Testers
	- Developers

## Timeboxing

- Each timebox is a planned portion of work
- Each timebox has a set time
- The team is empowered to do what they need to do in the timebox
- They must never compromise quality
- The project **never** moves to the next timebox until everyone agrees that the previous timebox is complete
- At the end of the timebox
	- The next timebox is planned
	- Including what will be done and how much time is needed
- Identify
- Plan
- Evolve
- Review
- Using MoSCoW
- Must haves
	- Are required
- Should haves
	- Great if there's enough time

### Timebox gone wrong

- If a timebox goes wrong
	- The project stops
	- Project manager intervenes
- Nothing goes forward until the timebox has been resolved

## Daily standups

- Happens every day
- Facilitated by the team lead or project manager
- Whole solution team participates
- Stakeholders are always welcome to listen and watch
- Each team member says
	- What they have been doing since the last stand up
	- What they will be doing now before the next stand up
	- Any problems/risks/issues they are encountering that is slowing progress
- Usually takes about 15min
	- 2 to 3 min per person

## Risk

- Risk is constantly evaluated
- Risk is assessed in each timebox
- Stakeholders can identify risk in an ongoing manner
