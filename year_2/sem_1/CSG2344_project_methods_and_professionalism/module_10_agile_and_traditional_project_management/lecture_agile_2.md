# Agile part 2

## Traditional incorporating agile

- Although some traditional project management teams may resist agile
- There is an increasing shift towards large scale projects that use both traditional and agile approaches to a project

### Benefits of agile vs. traditional integration

- Large scale projects may feel more comfortable with financial checks and balances of traditional project management
- ICT innovations that drive the success of many projects will be more successful and less risky if given an agile pathway through which to quickly develop solutions

## Agile is fast

- Agile methods generally out pace other ways because they allow developers to begin developing almost immediately
- Many large scale firms often complain that their software developers spend too much time sitting around waiting for projects
- Because it is more rewarding for developers
	- There is a tendency to see more creativity

## Feasibility can be set up in minutes

- The pre-project requirements for a feasibility can be simply a two minute discussion in an elevator
- Once you have made a pitch
	- And given the OK to proceed
	- The agile system ensures risk management by asking the **go / no go** question regularly
		- And at all iterations

### Go / No go

### Feasibility done in under an hour

- Feasibility sessions are typically done quickly
- Feasibility is simply a pathway to deciding that it is definitely worth proceeding
- Decide the basic needs
	- Scope
	- Usually less than 10 requirements

## Foundations

- This is where firm and enduring foundations are established
	- ie. Things that you cannot see changing in the life of the project
- Decide the baseline high-level requirements
	- **Prioritize requirements list**
- Decide the business processes that will be supported by the proposed solution
- Detail the business case
	- **Big picture**
- Identify the physical infrastructure of the solution
	- **EDUF**
- Define the technical standards
- Decode how the quality will be assured
- Describe the likely development lifecycle

### BADs, SADs and DADs

#### Business area definition (BAD)

- Business area definition should be created for any project where the proposed solution impacts on the way **business as usual** is conducted in the organization
- For software projects
	- This should include a statement from a business perspective of the expected life expectancy and maintenance strategy for the system to be used

#### System architecture definition (SAD)

- System architecture definition should be created for any project where there is a systems aspect to the solution
- It defines the technical framework within which the solution will be developed
- Provides a high level description of the architecture for that solution

#### Development approach definition (DAD)

- Development approach definition defines how the solution development team will develop
- And how they and other technical experts will assess the fitness for purpose of the solution
- All practices should be developed iteratively

## Exploration

- Iteratively and incrementally investigate detailed business requirements
	- Translate them into a viable solution
- Elaborate on the prioritize requirements list
- Explore the full detail of the business need
- Create a functional solution that demonstrably meets the needs of the business
- Only move to exploration once everything in foundations is completed

## Engineering

- Refine the evolving solution from the exploration phase
	- Refine the products required to successfully operate and support the solution
- Make sure that the evolving solution meets the original vision
- Make sure that the technical elements are sound
- All stakeholders must have some agreement here
- Constantly work towards a deployable solution

## Post project

- Deploy the solution
- Check that the benefits described in the business case have actually been achieved in the deployed solution
- All stakeholders are in agreement
- Business sponsor agrees
- Business visionary agrees

## MoSCoW

- Must have
- Should have
- Could have
- Wont have
	- Right now

## Timeboxing

- Each timebox is a planned portion of work
- Each timebox has a set time
- The team is empowered to do what they need to do in the timebox
- They must never compromise quality
- The project **never** moves to the next timebox until everyone agrees that the previous timebox is complete
- At the end of the timebox
	- The next timebox is planned
	- Including what will be done and how much time is needed
- Identify
- Plan
- Evolve
- Review
- Using MoSCoW
- Must haves
	- Are required
- Should haves
	- Great if there's enough time

### Timebox example

### Within each timebox

## Kick off

- Each iteration of a timebox starts off with a **kick off**
- Decide the objectives of the timebox
- Determine if it can be done in the allocated time
- Decide whether it is the right **next step** to take
- Agree on the acceptance criteria
- Analyze the risks for this timebox

## Controlling a timebox

- The 3 main stages of a timebox include
	- Investigation
	- Refinement
	- Consolidation

### Investigation

- 15%
- Detail of all the products to be delivered and in what quantities

### Refinement

- 70%
- The bulk of the development and testing
- Inline with agreed priorities

### Consolidation

- 15%
- Tying up loose ends and ensuring products meet the acceptance criteria

## Close out

- The formal acceptance of the timebox deliverables by the business visionary and the technical coordinator
- Close out ensures that what has been done has been accepted as finished

## Deployment

- After a number of successful iterations, a product may be ready to deploy
- Agile aims to get products deployed quickly so as to get results
	- Deployed products can still be refined to improve their results
- This is a fundamentally different philosophy to traditional project management

## Post product benefits assessment

- Describe how the benefits have accrued
	- ie. What has now improved
- Describe how the changes have been made
- Explain what has enabled formal acceptance to have been achieved

## Agile inside traditional project management

- Agile is designed to work **inside** a traditional project management environment
- Traditional project managers can have traditional elements going on in a large scale project
	- While also incorporating agile to assist rapid development of ICT innovation
