## Communications planning

- Every project should include some type of communications plan
	- A document that guides project communications
- Creating a stakeholder analysis for project communications also aids in communications planning

### Communications management plan contents

- Stakeholder communications requirements

	- Receive
	- Produce
- Suggest methods or technologies for conveying the information

## Information distribution

- Getting the right information to the right people at the right time in a useful format is just as important as developing the information in the first place
- Important considerations
	- Using technology to enhance information distribution
	- Formal and informal methods for distributing information

### What went wrong

- Telecommunications throughout Asia were severely disrupted on December 26, 2006
- Earthquakes off Taiwan damaged undersea cables
- Slowed Internet services
- Hindered financial transactions
	- Currency market
- International phone traffic was restricted from some countries
- Internet access slowed to a crawl

### Distributing information in an effective and timely manner

- Don't bury crucial information
- Don't be afraid to report bad information
- Oral communication via meetings and informal talks
	- Helps bring important information out into the open
		- Good and bad

### Importance of face to face communication

- Research says that in a face to face interaction
	- 58% of communication is through body language
	- 35% of communication is through how words are said
	- 7% of communication is through the content or words that are spoken
- Pay attention to more than just the actual words someone is saying
- A person's tone of voice and body language say a lot about how he/she really feels

### Encourage more face to face interactions

- Short, frequent meetings are often very effective in IT projects
- Stand up meetings force people to focus on what they really need to communicate
- Some companies have policies preventing the use of email between certain hours or even entire days of the week

## Understanding group and individual communication needs

- People are not interchangeable parts
- As illustrated in Brook's book *The Mythical Man-Moth*
	- You cannot assume that a task originally scheduled to take two months of a person's time can be done in one month by two people
- Nine women cannot produce a baby in one month

### Personal preferences affect communication needs

- Introverts like more private communication
	- Extroverts like to discuss things in public
- Intuitive people like to understand the big picture
	- Sensing people need step-by-step details
- Thinkers want to know the logic behind decisions
	- Feeling people want to know how something affects them personally
- Judging people are driven to meet deadlines
	- Perceiving people need more help in developing and following plans

### Other communication considerations

- Rarely does the receiver interpret a message exactly as the sender intended
- Geographic location and cultural background affect the complexity of project communications
	- Different working hours
	- Language barriers
	- Different cultural norms

## Determining the number of communications channels

- The complexity of communications increase with number of people involved
	- There are more communications channels/pathways through which people can communicate
- Number of channels:

>(n(n-1)) /  2

- Where n = number of people involved

### Impact of number of people on communications channels

## Performance reporting

- Performance reporting keeps stakeholders informed about how resources are being used to achieve project objectives
- Status reports
	- Describe where the project stands at a specific point in time
- Progress reports
	- Describe what the project team has accomplished during a certain period of time
- Forecasts
	- Predict future project status and progress based on past information/trends

## Managing stakeholders

- Project managers must understand and work with various stakeholders
- Need to devise a way to identify and resolve issues
- Two important tools
	- Expectations management matrix
	- Issue log

## Suggestions for improving project communications

- Manage conflicts effectively
- Develop better communication skills
- Run effective meetings
- Use email and other technologies effectively
- Use templates for project communications

## Conflict handling modes

- Confrontation
	- Directly face a conflict using a problem solving approach
- Compromise
	- Use a give and take approach
- Smoothing
	- De-emphasize areas of difference
	- Emphasize areas of agreement
- Forcing
	- Win/lose approach
- Withdrawal
	- Retreat/withdraw from actual/potential disagreement

### Conflict can be good

- Conflict often produces important results
	- New ideas
	- Better alternatives
	- Motivation to work harder
	- Work more collaboratively
- Groupthink
	- Conformance to the values or ethical standards of a group
	- Can develop if there are no conflicting viewpoints
- Research suggests that
	- Task related conflict often improves team performance
	- Emotional conflict depresses team performance

## Developing better communication skills

- Companies and formal degree programs for IT professionals often neglect the importance of these skills
	- Speaking
	- Writing
	- Listening
- As organizations become more global
	- They realize they must invest in ways to improve communications with people from different countries and cultures
- It takes leadership to improve communication

## Running effective meetings

- Determine if a meeting can be avoided
- Define the purpose and intended outcome of the meeting
- Determine who should attend the meeting
- Provide an agenda to participants before the meeting
- Prepare handouts/visual aids
	- Make logistical arrangements ahead of time
- Run meetings professionally
- Build relationships

## Using technology/collaborative tools effectively

- Make sure that emails/IM or collaborative tools are appropriate medium for what you want to communicate
- Be sure to send information to the right people
- Emails
	- Use meaningful subject lines
	- Limit content of emails to one subject
	- Be as clear and concise as possible
- Be sure to authorize the right people to share/edit collaborative documents

## Best practice

- In June 2006, CIO magazine surveyed information technology executives on their best practices for managing innovation in business
- When asked what technologies they plan to implement or leverage in the coming year:
	- 54% of respondents reported handheld PCs/PDAs as the most important hardware
	- 56% cited Web services as the most important software
	- 53% cited wireless technologies as the most important Internet technology
- These technologies will help organizations improve communications by allowing workers to communicate any time and anywhere

## Using templates for project communications

- Many technical people are afraid to ask for help
- Providing examples/templates for project communications saves time/money
- Organizations can develop their own templates
	- Use some provided by outside organizations
	- Use samples from textbooks
- Research shows that companies that excel in project management make effective use of templates

## Lessons learned reports

- Project manager and project team members should each prepare a **lessons learned report**
	- A reflective statement that documents important things an individual learned from working on the project
- The project manager often combines information from all of the lessons learned reports into a project summary report

## Project archives

- It is also important to organize and prepare project archives
- They are a complete set of organized project records that provide an accurate history of the project
- These archives can provide valuable information for future projects as well

## Project websites

- Many project teams create a project website to store important product documents and other information
- Can create the site using various types of software
	- Enterprise project management software

## Using software to assist in project communications

- There are many software tools to aid in project communications
- Today, many people telecommute to work remotely at least part time
- Project management software includes new capabilities to enhance virtual communications
- New tools can enhance project communications
	- IM
	- Blogs

## Summary
