# Intro to project management

## The need for project management

- Computing is still a young field
- Very early computer programs were
	- Aimed at efficiency of a known algorithm
	- Written, maintained and used by an *individual*
	- No systematic methods
		- More art form than science
- Today's applications are
	- Found in every sphere of our lives
	- Often large and complex
	- Developed by teams
- What have been the big steps forward in computing since the early days?

## Emerging reliance on software

- Growing gap between demand and supply
- Expectation for software delivery to be
	- On time
	- On budget
	- Meeting requirements
- Maintenance problem
	- Base of existing software needs fixing / changing
	- What is the proportion of new to existing software?
- Society increasingly dependent on *reliable*, *high quality* software

## The track record

- What is the state of the software industry today?
	- Is there demand for software?
	- Is so, what types?
	- Do we develop applications well?
	- How do we know how well we do?
	- Are there areas of improvement?

## Why has the state of play improved?

>The reasons for the increase in successful projects vary.

- Better tools have been created to monitor and control progress
- Better skilled project managers
- Better management processes are being used
- The fact there are processes is significant in itself

## Why do projects fail?

- The user did not know what he wanted
- The user changed his mind
- The programmers missed deadlines
- The programmers were called to other projects
- The software support changed halfway
- The user changed his mind again
- The due dates were impossible anyway
- The user left the job
- All the above are wrong!

### Why projects fail... the truth

- Poor project management
- Lack of a systematic process
	- Larger projects have the lowest success rate
		- Are more risky than medium and smaller projects
	- Technology, business models and markets change so rapidly that a project that takes more than a year can be obsolete before they are completed
- Inadequate support from top management
- Poor communication with client
- Neglecting the human factor
- Untested technology
- Therefore... **poor project management**

### Top 10 factors for IT success

1. Executive support
2. User involvement
3. Experienced project manager
4. Clear business objectives
5. Minimized scope
6. Standard software infrastructure
7. Firm basic requirements
8. Formal methodology
9. Reliable estimates
10. Other

		- Quality

## Project integration management

![pmbok model](http://snag.gy/sh0Bt.jpg)

- This is the coordination of all areas and so is actually made up of a plan for each of the 0 other knowledge or functional areas
- It involves ensuring that all other 9 areas are being managed properly
- Note that as of 2014, we cite 10 knowledge management areas
	- Stakeholder management
		- Previous versions of PMBOK and Schwalbe do not include it

## Knowledge areas within project management

### Core knowledge areas

- **Project scope management**
	- Involves defining and managing all the tasks required to complete the project successfully
- **Project time management**
	- Includes estimating how long it will take to complete the work
	- Develop an acceptable project schedule
	- Ensure timely completion of the project
- **Project cost management**
	- Consists of preparing and managing the budget for the project
- **Project quality management**
	- Ensures that the project will satisfy the stated or implied needs for which it was undertaken

### Project objectives achievement areas

- **Project human resource management**

	- Involves acquiring or procuring goods and services for a project outside the performing organization

### The triple constraint

- Every project is constrained in different ways
	- Scope
		- What tasks will be done as part of the project?
		- What unique product, service or result does the customer or sponsor expect from the project?
	- Time
		- How long should it take to complete the project?
		- What is the project's schedule?
	- Cost
		- What should it cost to complete the project?
		- What is the project's budget?

### The quadruple constraint

- The quadruple constraint now includes **quality**
	- It is the project manager's duty to balance these often competing goals
	- What is the issue with **quality**?

## What should a project manager be competent in?

- Create a list of ten areas a project manager should be skilled in
