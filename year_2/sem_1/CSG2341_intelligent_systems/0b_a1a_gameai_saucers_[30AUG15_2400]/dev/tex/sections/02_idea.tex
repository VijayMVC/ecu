\section{Idea}

The tactics of this controller are based on two facts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Saucers will always consume energy, no matter what they are doing.
	\item Cannon rounds are much more effective at close range.
\end{itemize}

Since saucers will always consume energy during all regimes of flight, it is much more efficient to be in a position to fire the weapon and attempt to degrade the enemy's energy at a faster rate, rather than fly defensively without firing at all. It is also more effective to be within close range of the enemy to cause more damage with the cannon, but on the other hand, the enemy's cannon will also be just as dangerous.\\
\\
Therefore, the tactics of the controller will be as discussed below.

\subsection{Flight regimes}

If the enemy is far or near while winning or the score is even, commit to engagement and fly aggressively towards the enemy. Otherwise if the enemy is close, and winning or the score is even, fly at a slow speed to stay within close range. This will allow the enemy to pass so that the saucer can stay behind the enemy and avoid overshooting him. During winning or even scores, the saucer will always turn towards the enemy attempting to close the distance to a much more lethal firing range.

If losing, break contact and fly away from the enemy at the appropriate speed. If close, fly fast away from the enemy. If near, fly moderately, and if far, then fly at slow speed to conserve energy.

\subsection{Weapon employment}

Since can
