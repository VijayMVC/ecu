Storage is becoming ever larger, solid state disks are becoming common, computers are joined into clusters sharing a storage. . .

@article{Rosenblum1992,
abstract = {This paper presents a new technique for disk storage management called a log-structured file system. A logstructured file system writes all modifications to disk sequentially in a log-like structure, thereby speeding up both file writing and crash recovery. The log is the only structure on disk; it contains indexing information so that files can be read back from the log efficiently. In order to maintain large free areas on disk for fast writing, we divide the log into segments and use a segment cleaner to compress the live information from heavily fragmented segments. We present a series of simulations that demonstrate the efficiency of a simple cleaning policy based on cost and benefit. We have implemented a prototype logstructured file system called Sprite LFS; it outperforms current Unix file systems by an order of magnitude for small-file writes while matching or exceeding Unix performance for reads and large writes. Even when the overhead for cleaning is included, Sprite LFS can use 70 \% of the disk bandwidth for writing, whereas Unix file systems typically can use only 5-10\%. 1.},

The work involves mathematical analysis of the file system access time with and without journaling option. The performance is measured using the Postmark benchmarking software that simulates the workload of Internet mail server. We have defined three types of workloads, generally dominated by relatively small objects. Test results have shown superiority of modern ext4 file system compared to its predecessors, ext2 and ext3 file systems. Benchmark results are interpreted based on mathematical model of file system access times.},

Using our technique, we analyze if journaling file systems maintain on-disk consistency in the presence of disk write failures. We apply our technique to three important Linux journaling file systems: ext3, Reiserfs, and IBM JFS. From our analysis, we identify several design flaws and correctness bugs in these file systems, which can cause serious file system errors ranging from data corruption to unmountable file systems.},
