\subsection{Virtual memory managers}

\begin{itemize}
\item \citetapos{Blanchet2012} book is aimed at readers wishing to learn about the essential architecture of a computer as a whole. However, chapter 9 (p. 175 - 204) provides insight into the functionality of virtual memory management.
\item The authors introduce virtual management with a brief history, and explain the purpose and the trade-off when using virtual memory.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \citet{Blanchet2012} assert that delays may occur while data is transferred between physical memory and mass storage.
	\end{itemize}
\item They explain how physical memory and a mass storage device interact to provide virtual memory through the use of paging, and briefly cover fetch and page fault algorithms. Page size considerations are also listed, and referred to as ``conflicting criteria''. The chapter also introduces the concept of multi-level paging.
\item \citet{Blanchet2012} then provide a detailed and technical step-by-step view of virtual memory management at work, using a program execution as an example.
