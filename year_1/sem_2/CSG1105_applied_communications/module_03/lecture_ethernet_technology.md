# Ethernet technology

## Ethernet formats

### Ethernet frame

![ethernet frame](http://snag.gy/xKel9.jpg)

- Comparison to ethernet II
	- Identical preamble
	- No SFD
		- Start Frame Delimiter
	- 2-byte Type filed in place of Length field
	- Data field longer than 1500 bytes
- Bits transmitted LSB to MSB
	- Most significant byte
- Size
	- Minimum: 72 bytes
	- Maximum: 1526 bytes

### Interframe gap

![interframe gap](http://snag.gy/17cm6.jpg)

- Idle time append to end of every frame
	- Network media can stabilize
	- Network components can process frame
- 10 Mbps Ethernet: 9.6 microseconds interframe gap
	- Corresponds to 96 bit times
- Minimum-length Ethernete frame
	- Followed by 96 bit times of silence
	- 14,880 frames/second frame rate
- **Note:**
	- Calculation below uses minimum frame size to demonstrate worst-case scenario

![lost bandwidth](http://snag.gy/DVBWQ.jpg)

- When frame size is larger:
	- More available bandwidth utilized
	- 96-byte interframe gap becomes less significant

#### Note

- The size of interframe gap is amount of time to take at transmission rate to transmit 96 bits

## Collision detection

### CSMA/CD

![10base5 ethernet network](http://snag.gy/tJL59.jpg)

- Allows bandwidth sharing
- Collision domain
	- Portion of LAN (or entire LAN)
		- Two or more transmitting stations interfere with each other

#### No collision during frame

- Station waits an idle period
	- Equal to (or longer than) the interframe gap
- Station begins transmitting from one bit at a time
- Electronic signal represents each bit traveled
	- Limited speed within thickwire coax
	- 10.8 microseconds worst case to travel 2500 meters from station A to station B
	- Time based on cable speed coefficient
- Signal absorbed at coaxial segment endpoint
	- By terminating resistor

#### A collision occurs during the frame

- Ethernet transceivers detect signal, energy distortions
- Stations output a jam sequence
	- Begin random waiting period before retransmitting
- Station must still be transmitting to detect collisions
- Round-trip time
	- Important to collision detection

![collision example](http://snag.gy/aZKlY.jpg)

#### Detecting errors

- Transceiver listens to itself as it transmits
- If signals do not match:
	- Most likely due to collision
	- Network malfunction

#### Jam sequence

- Generated by stations detecting collision
- 32-bit pattern
	- Propagates collision throughout the network

#### Random waiting period

- Multiple of ethernet slot time
	- Time required to transmit 512 bits

## Features of different ethernet technologies

### Ethernet controllers

- Network interface card digital operations
	- Transmit and receive ethernet frames
		- Performed by a single dedicated ASIC (Application Specific Integerated Circuit) ethernet controller
- ASIC

- Fast link pulses
	- Autonegotiation between each end of 100baseT link
	- Series of short pulses exchanged between ports
		- 33 pulses in series (17 clock pulses, 16 data pulses)
- Two repeater types
	- Class I
		- Translates between many 100baseT technologies
	- Class II
		- Faster, supports a single technology
- 100VG-AnyLAN

## Troubleshooting techniques

- Common problems encountered in actual network
	- MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
		- Maximum frame size allowed on the network
		- Affects bandwidth
	- Jabber
		- Frame longer than 1526 bytes
	- Runt
		- Any transmitted frame with length less than the minimum frame size
		- Includes short frame with valid FCS
	- Alignment error
		- Last bit received is not last bit of the frame final byte
		- Frame bits not a multiple of eight
		- Caused FCS to be invalid, frame discarded
		- Caused by intermittent connections, collisions
	- Cabling errors
		- Coax, UTP
		- Lost termination
		- Excess utilisation
