21. If an attack is taking place, capturing the traffic will provide \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ that may lead to the identity of the attacker and techniques used to perform the attack.
	- Evidence
22. USB \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ can be configured with their own bootable operating systems.
	- Thumb drives
23. A/n \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ IDS will take action on its own to handle the problem without user intervention.
