# Remedial mathematics for algorithm analysis

## Task 1: Test Euclid GCD algorithm

Euclid's GCD algorithm is shown on slides 7 - 8 in module 1 lecture. A segment of Java code applying this algorithm is given on slide 9 of slides.

Consider the two sets of paired integers (12, 18) and (54, 36):

1. Find the GCD of these two sets by:
	1. Verifying your answers by hand-testing the Euclid GCD algorithm
	2. Using the GCD Java program in your computer
2. Discuss the relationship between an algorithm and a program

## Task 2: omputation of powers of a number by different ways

Calculate 2<sup>6</sup> by hand in as many was as you can find and compare their efficiency in terms of multiplications.

>2<sup>6</sup> = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 5 steps  
2<sup>6</sup> = 2 * 2 = 4; 4 * 4 * 4 = 3 steps  
2<sup>6</sup> = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8; 8 * 8 = 3 steps
