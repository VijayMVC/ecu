\section{Arrays}

The array data structure is demonstrated through the implementation of a simple lotto game. The lotto game allows up to 1000 players, with each player picking six unique integers, between 1 and 45, which makes up their lotto ticket. Each player and their respective lotto tickets are represented inside a two-dimensional array, while the winning numbers are represented inside a one-dimensional array.
\\
\\
The following classes have been created to represent the lotto game:

\begin{itemize}
\item \mintinline{java}{Main}: The executable class, contains \mintinline{java}{main()} method
\item \mintinline{java}{PlayerTickets}: Generates a two-dimensional array which represents each player, and their picks for the lotto ticket
\item \mintinline{java}{WinningNumbers}: Generates a one-dimensional array which represents the winning numbers for the lotto game
\item \mintinline{java}{WinningPlayers}: Contains logic to determine who the winning players are
\item \mintinline{java}{Sorter}: Helper class to sort \mintinline{java}{PlayerTickets} and \mintinline{java}{WinningNumbers} arrays
\item \mintinline{java}{Randomizer}: Helper class to generate random numbers for each player pick and winning number
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sorting}

In order to use more efficient search algorithms such as binary search, the arrays must be sorted first. The \mintinline{java}{Sorter} class contains \mintinline{java}{insertionSort()} which is called to sort elements in an array in descending order using insertion sort algorithm. Implementation is shown in Java code 2.1.

\subsubsection{Insertion sort algorithm}

To sort a[left...right] into ascending order:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For r = left + 1, ..., right, repeat:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let val = a[r]
	\item Insert val into its correct sorted position in a[left...r]
	\end{enumerate}
\item Terminate
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Insertion sort Java method}

\begin{listing}[H]
\caption{Insertion sort method}
\begin{javacode}
private static final int[] insertionSort(int[] array) {

    // 1.0 For r = left+1, ..., right, repeat:
    for(int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {

        // 1.1 Let val = a[r] (replaced with key)
        int key = array[i];

        // 1.2 Insert val into a[left...r] in such a way that 
        // the subarray is sorted

        // j tracks the sorted invariant
        int j = i - 1;

        // while j >= 0 and array[j] > key,
        while(j >= 0 && array[j] > key) {

            // set array[j + 1] to array[j]
            array[j + 1] = array[j];
            // decrement j
            j--;
        }

        // after inner loop, set array[j + 1] to key
        array[j + 1] = key;
    }

    // 2.0 Terminate
    return array;
}
\end{javacode}
