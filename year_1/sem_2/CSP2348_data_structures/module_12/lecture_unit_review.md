# Exam preparation

- Review questions in weekly WSs and RQs
- Must have read corresponding chapters of your book AT LEAST once
- Pay attention to those algorithms in
	- Lectures
	- Tutorials
	- Review questions
	- Tests
- Pay more attention to content of first 8 modules
- Module content in YELLOW (in ppt) are not required
	- Only appear in a few questions in MCQ
	- Includes
		- Hash tables
		- Vectors
		- Iterators

## Exam time management

- Best way to allocate time in an exam is based on the marks per question
	- Target 1 minute per mark for MCQs
	- 2 minutes per mark for other questions
		- Allowing a 10min buffer given 100 marks in 180 minutes
	- Use buffer at end for revision and finishing off longer or difficult questions
	- If you finish a section before time is up, add this time to buffer, not the next section

## Answering Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)

- Read the questions carefully
	- Look out for words that change the meaning of the question
		- Like not
		- Or underlined words
- If you don't know, guess
- If you have to guess, be clever about it
	- Eliminate obviously wrong answers
	- Watch out for distractors
		- Answers that try to distract you from the correct answer

## Other exam tips

### Before exam

1. Read texts and review all notes
	- Lecture slides are not enough
	- Don't expect to find hints from textbook during exam
		- Won't have enough time to look for similar cases
2. Re-attempt
	- Workshops
	- Weekly review questions
	- Questions from two tests
3. Ask tutor about anything you don't understand

### During exam

1. Don't panic
2. Don't expect perfect solution/s
3. Secure the easy marks in all questions first
	- Come back to harder ones when time is available
4. Timing
