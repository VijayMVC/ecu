## 2:

Consider Newton's algorithm to calculate the square root of a number.

1. Use algorithm to calculate square roots of: 4, 6, 8, 9
	- In each case, calculate to accuracy of 0.01
		- ie. The absolute difference between a and r<sup>2</sup> is less than 0.01
2. Write a Java program to implement the algorithm and use it to check your answers
3. What would happen if step 2 of the algorithm were as follows?
	- 2. Until r<sup>2</sup> = a, repeat:

#### Answers:

##### 1:

Square root of 4.

```
1.	r = (1 + a) / 2
	r = (1 + 4) / 2
	r = 2.5
2. 	r^2 = a?
	2.5^2 != 4
		2.1 r = (r + (a / r)) / 2
			r = (2.5 + (4 / 2.5)) / 2
			r = 2.05
3.	r^2 = a?
	2.05^2 != a
		3.1 r = (r + (a / r)) / 2
			r = (2.05 + (4 / 2.05)) / 2
			r = 2.0006
4.	r^2 = a?
	2.0006^2 = a
5.	r = 2.0006
```

Square root of 6

```
1.	r = (1 + 6) / 2
	r = 3.5
2. 	3.5^2 != 6
	2.1 r = (3.5 + (6 / 3.5)) / 2
		r = 2.607
3.	2.607^2 != 6
	3.1 r = (2.607 + (6 / 2.607)) / 2
		r = 2.454
4.	2.454^2 != 6
	4.1 r = (2.454 + (6 / 2.454)) / 2
		r = 2.449
5.	2.449^2 = 6
6.	r = 2.449
```

## 3:

Give some examples of algorithms used in every day life, not requiring a calculator or computer.

## 4:

Write an algorithm to perform each of the following tasks:

1. Use an automated bank teller to withdraw cash from your account
2. Set the current time on your watch
3. Cook a frozen meal in a microwave
4. Match the pair of socks in a bundle of freshly laundered socks

## 5:

Try to find further examples of early algorithms like the ones given in this chapter.

## 6:

Devise an algorithm to find the roots of the general quadratic equation:

>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0

The roots are the two values of the formula:

>(-b Â± &radic;(b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)) / 2a
