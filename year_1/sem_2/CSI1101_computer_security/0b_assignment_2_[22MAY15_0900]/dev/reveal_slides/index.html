					# Introduction

				<section data-markdown>
					### In the previous report...

					We found security issues with:

					- The operating system
					- Third party applications
					- User practices
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### This presentation will...

					Recommend solutions to each of those issues and:

					- Outline advantages/disadvantages where possible
					- Introduce alternatives where possible
					- Briefly discuss process where possible

					Starting with...
				</section>

				<!-- **OPERATING SYSTEM** -->

				<section data-markdown>
					# The operating system
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## Some facts about Windows Vista Business

					- It's getting old
						- Superseded by two versions of Windows
							- Almost three, with the pending release of Windows 10
					- Will eventually become obsolete
						- Extended support ends on 11 April 2017 [(Microsoft, 2015)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/default.aspx?alpha=Vista)
					- Third party applications used by Blue Ink may also eventually end support for Vista
				</section>

				<!-- Nested slides can't be in markdown -->
				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>What does this mean?</h2>

						<ul>
							<li>Microsoft will no longer provide security updates for Vista after 11 April 2017</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Only around two years left</li>
								</ul>
							<li>If or when vendors of third party applications decide to stop supporting Vista</li>
								<ul>
									<li>That particular application may no longer receive security updates as well</li>
								</ul>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>What are security updates anyway?</h3>

						<p>
							When a security vulnerability in a program has been found or disclosed, the developer may release an update for the program to resolve the known vulnerability in order to stop it being exploited by attackers.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>So when an operating system/application is no longer supported...</h3>

						<p>
							Any known vulnerabilities after the end of support date will not be resolved, leaving the system susceptible to those vulnerabilities.
						</p>

						</section>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## How do we fix it?

					### Upgrade!

					- Upgrade to a modern version of Microsoft Windows
						- ie. Windows 8.1, Microsoft's latest version of Windows
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Advantages

					- Computer/s will no longer be susceptible to vulnerabilities associated with Windows Vista
					- Microsoft's support will be extended [(Microsoft, 2014)](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/lifecycle)
						- ie. Microsoft Windows 8.1 support ends 9 January 2018
							- Extended support ends 10 January 2023
					- Software included with operating systems such as Internet Explorer or Windows Defender will also be upgraded
						- ie. Windows 8.1 ships with Internet Explorer 11 [(Microsoft, n.d)](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/internet-explorer/ie-system-requirements#ie=ie-11)
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Disadvantages

					- New license for each copy of OS must be purchased
					- Current hardware may also need upgrades in order to run new OS
					- Deployment of new OS may require down time
					- Users may depend on software which may not be compatible with new OS
					- Staff may require training in use of new OS
						- User interface may have evolved since Vista
					- Computer/s will then become susceptible to unresolved vulnerabilities in new OS
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					## What's the alternative option?

					### Update!

					- Service packs and security updates must be installed
						- No service packs or security updates have been installed yet
					- **524** known vulnerabilities for all versions of Windows Vista [(Ozkan, 2015)](http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-26/product_id-9591)
						- From SP0 through to SP2
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### For example...

					CVE-2008-0951 describes an *Auto-run* vulnerability which [(SecurityFocus, 2008)](http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/28360):

					- Allows an attacker to include malicious code on removable media
						- ie. CD-ROM or USB drive
					- The malicious code will be executed once the removable media is inserted into the computer
				</section>

				<section data-markdown>
					### Without any updates...

					Blue Ink's computers are susceptible to all 524 known vulnerabilities.

					Lack of updates have also kept included software such as Internet Explorer severely outdated.

					| IE version | No. of vulnerabilities |
					|------------|------------------------|
					| IE 7       | 206                    |
					| IE 8       | 249                    |
					| IE 9       | 292                    |
