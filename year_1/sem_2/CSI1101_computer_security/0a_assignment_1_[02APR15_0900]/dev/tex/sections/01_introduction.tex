\section{Introduction}

The Board of Directors at Blue Ink have recently become aware of the lack of computer security awareness and best practices amongst its employees. As a result, Blue Ink have requested that a sample Virtual Machine (VM) image of a typical computer within their organisation be analysed for security issues.

This report outlines the security issues identified during the analysis of Blue Ink's sample VM image. Vulnerabilities have been found with the operating system itself, and support software packaged with the operating system, such as the Internet browser and anti-virus application. Vulnerabilities have also been identified in outdated software. Practices regarding the storage of passwords in plain-text files within user documents folder must also change in order to maintain desired security.
