## What is privacy

>The right to be let alone  

US Supreme Court Judge Louis Brandeis (1928)

>Privacy is about protecting information that says who we are, what we do, what we think, what we believe  

Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (2014)

>Privacy is the ability of you the individual to exercise a substantial degree of control over the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information

Fenton & Associates (2014) [Lawyers]

>Privacy is fundamentally about the power of the individual

Garfinkel (2000)

## The changing nature of privacy

>Subtler and more far-reaching means of invading privacy has become available to the government. Discovery and invention have made it possible for the government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet

-- US Supreme Court Justice Brandeis (1928)

- Notice the date of the above quote
- To which sorts of discovery and invention is Brandeis referring
- How has technology changed since this quote was made
- This is going to be the main theme of this lecture

## I have nothing to hide, why should I care

- A company processed data from surveys, warranty cards etc.
- People participated in surveys in return for product samples, promotions
- Processing of these surveys was outsourced
- The contracted company then in turn contracted out the task again, to inmates within the Texas prison system
	- A cost effective solution
- Many women reported receiving mail from inmates convicted of rap
	- She indicated that the mail was very comprehensive and included details of the soaps and other hygiene products that she used
	- The mail also indicated that the inmate would be paying her a visit when released
- The woman initiated a class action lawsuit against the company

## Threats to privacy

- Threats posed by individuals
	- Hacking, unauthorised system access
	- Theft of computers, media etc.
	- Trojans, keyloggers etc.
- Threats imposed by governments
	- Various databases
	- Echelon, Carnivore, TIA
	- Wiretapping, email surveillance etc.
- Threats posed by commercial entities
	- Web browsing habits, cookies etc.
	- Tags, RFIDs etc.

## Threats posed by individuals

- Information could be stolen/collected/harvested in any number of ways
	- Keyloggers
	- Trojans
	- Unauthorised access / hacking
	- Theft of computer hardware
- Could be used for any number of purposes
	- Identity Theft
	- Fraud

### Identity Theft

>An identity thief co-opts some piece of your personal information and appropriates it without your knowledge to commit fraud or theft

-- US Federal Trade Commission

- Theft of information
	- Could be in physical form
		- What does the contents of your wallet say about you
		- How about the contents of your mailbox
		- How about someone stealing your laptop
	- Could be information in an electronic form
		- What information could someone find or deduce as a result of gaining access to your computer
			- Federal Trade Commission (2003; 2005)
- If someone could build a persona based on your identity what might they try and do
	- Take out a loan
	- Access your personal finances
	- Register a vehicle
	- Lease accommodation
	- Open an ISP account
	- Commit a criminal activity

### However

- Privacy is more than just about preventing identity theft
- A stated earlier, privacy is also about
	- Self possession
	- Personal integrity
- Should we view this in terms of
	- Why should I care, I have nothing to hide
	- Or Why should anybody know these things about me
	- Why should it be any of their business

## Big data

- Online tracking devices/programs
	- May not be malicious/detectable by AV software
	- Can help with logging into sites
	- Can send back information on pages you visit
	- Capture information on your searches
	- Your location

### Marketing companies love big data

- Provides information on spending patterns
- Your online behaviour
- Allows marketing companies to explicitly target you
- Google scans emails to help it target specific ads to users

### Online profilers

- Acxiom, the largest profiler has ~500 million profiles of people worldwide
- Acxiom has data on 75% of Australian adults
- Acxiom collects data on Australians from
	- The public domain
	- Surveys
	- Third parties

### Cookies

- Cookies are a small bit of information stored on a computer associated with a server
	- When a website is accessed, the server may store data as a cookie
	- Every time you revisit that server, the cookie is resent
	- Effectively used to hold state information over sessions
- Cookies can hold sensitive information
	- This includes
		- Passwords
		- Credit card information
		- Social security number
	- Almost every large website uses cookies
- Cookies stored on your computer can be controlled
- Cookies can be accessed by non-legitimate servers
	- Many sites require that you enable cookies to use the sites
	- You should clear your cookies on a regular basis
- Cookies expire
	- The expiration is set by the site's session by default, which is chosen by the server
	- This means that cookies will probably stick around for awhile

### Banner advertisements

- Websites can display banner ads that are served from 3rd party sites
- These servers can set and retrieve cookies and track movement of users between websites
- **Click fraud** can lead to banners leading users to malware

### Web bugs

- Similar to banner advertisements except web bugs are 1x1 pixel images which are often the same colour as the page background so that they are not noticed
- Allows a third party to monitor if a web page or email has been opened by a victim
- Once an email address is known to be active it will attract substantially more spam

### Who do we give our information to

- What about information we give out voluntarily
- How many of us have given personal information to entities such as websites
- How many of us have ever taken the time to read the privacy policies of these websites

### Rewards for providing personal data

![rewards](http://snag.gy/a3NNJ.jpg)

## Threats posed by governments

>How should government balance the needs for privacy and adequate law enforcement?  
How have things changed since Sept 11, 2001?

-- New laws

### Terrorism information awareness programs

- Originally called Total Information Awareness (TIA)
- Uses predictive policing to gather information about individuals in order to anticipate and prevent crimes
- Used for "War on terror" to find terrorists around the globe
- TIA was biggest surveillance program in US history
- Suspended in 2003 by US Congress after critical media reports suggested it included all citizens
- Despite program being formally suspended, the data mining software was adopted by other agencies and is now "quietly thriving" at the National Security Agency (NSA)

### But we can trust our governments

- Icelandic government created a database of the medical records/DNA profiles of entire population
- The government then decided to sell this database to a US genetic research company
	- In 1998, the Icelandic government gave the US company exclusive rights to this information for 12 years
- Opt in or opt out
	- Principle of assumed consent
	- The Icelandic government assumed that citizens consented unless they specifically opted out
	- The bill that gave the US company these rights, did not specify that the company would have to tell citizens what sort of research would be conducted (Garfinkel, 2000)
- See http://www.actionbioscience.org/genomic/hlodan.html

## Workplace surveillance

- Can be performed in a number of ways
	- Closed circuit TV (CCTV)
	- Proxy server logs
	- Email monitoring
- What can an employer do in the Workplace
	- Monitor web usage logs
	- Monitor email logs
	- Read emails

### Monitoring of public places

- CCTV
- License plate recognition
- Face recognition
- RFID tags

### CCTV

- Designed to stop or deter criminal activity
- A 2010 empirical investigation into CCTV in UK secondary schools found
	- It is commonplace for cameras to be installed in toilets / change rooms
- Do schools distrust the behaviours of their kids
- Is this infringing upon ones personal space
- Is this a breach of ones privacy
- Research has identified that CCTV camera operators continually misuse systems
	- Zooming and panning functions are used for voyeuristic purposes
	- Criminal activity is often missed or overlooked
- Who is responsible for ensuring privacy whilst you are present in public space

### Vehicle recognition

- Realtime license plate recognition is a possibility
- Several cities around the world have considered implementing vehicle tracking systems, for a number of reasons including
	- Toll payments
	- Traffic management
- Imagine cameras capturing and identifying license plate numbers at key points in a city and funneling that information to vast databases
	- For what purpose could that information be used
	- Who might have access to it
	- What safeguards would be put in place
	- For how long would it be stored
	- With what other data might it be matched

### Face recognition

- We discussed face recognition in the module dealing with biometrics
- We discussed face recognition as a form of authentication, although it can also be used as a means of identification
- Governments and law enforcement agencies, who have long been supportive of such technologies are also beginning to see a downside
	- Could biometrics identification such as face recognition be used by organised crime syndicates to identify undercover law enforcement agents

### RFID tags

- Radio frequency tags
- Very small
	- No power supply
	- Power comes from signal sent to RFID tag
	- Not easily noticeable
- Able to be implanted in a variety of items
	- Clothes
	- Tyres
	- Other mundane items
	- People

### Tracking RFID tags

- What information could be gathered and aggregated as a result of tracking RFID tags
- If the tyres in your car had implanted RFID tags
- What if your trousers, shirt, jumper, hat and sunglasses etc all had their own implanted RFID tag
	- Not only could a person's movements conceivably be tracked, but also the combinations of clothing worn
	- How valuable would this be to a clothing manufacturer
- Pets can already be chipped using similar technologies
	- What about people

### RFID in use

- Gordon County School District is running a pilot program of using RFID tags to track school kids on buses
	- Purpose to identify truants
- Could the system be misused
	- Stalkers
	- People preying on children

## Data storage / aggregation / mining

- Vast amount of information can be collected from any number of sources, including some of those mentioned in this lecture
- What happens when large databases are combined to form larger databases
- Increasing computer power and efficient data mining and analysis software means that increasingly large volumes of data can be effectively processed and mined

### Cost of media

- The cost of storage media per megabyte is falling rapidly
	- A DVD that can hold 4.7gb costs less than 50c
	- A 2TB drive costs less than $100
	- How large was the average drive 10 years ago
	- Also the possibilities of revolutionary breakthroughs that might accelerate these trends even more
- What incentive is there for data to be deleted
- Will we keep storing data for longer
	- 4.7gb is alot of log files that can be burnt to a DVD and stored in a filing cabinet
- In the near future, will we ever need to destroy/delete data

## Data, information and intelligence

- So, if we keep storing more and more data
- And we keep finding increasingly efficient methods of visualising, mining and processing data
- What will the effect be on personal privacy

### Personal control of information

- What information about you is already out there
- Is there publicly available information about you on the web
	- If have a telephone registered in your name then the answer is probably yes
		- Not only does it give out names, addresses, phone numbers etc.
			- It will also display a nice little online map pointing out your address
	- What about other sources
- How much control do you have over this information
	- Once information is out there, what control do we have over it
	- Can we get it back
	- Can we be sure that all instances of it are gone

### How aware are we

- How aware are we of privacy issues
- How many people have ever stopped to read a privacy policy on a web site
- How many of you have ever read the End User License Agreements (EULA) on software
- How do we know what information software on our computers send out
	- See http://www.securityfocus.com/news/2746

## Phishing

- Forged web pages created to fraudulently acquire sensitive information
- User typically solicited to access phished page from spam email
- Most targeted sites
	- Financial services
	- Payment services
	- Online auctions

### Phishing example

![phishing example](http://i.imgur.com/xQTKzgA.png)

### URL obfuscation

- Actual URL different from spoofed URL displayed in address bar
- Unicode attack
	- Domain names with unicode chars can be registered
	- Identical or very similar graphic rendering for some characters
		- ie. Cyrillic and Latin 'a'
	- Phishing attack on p**a**ypal.com
	- Current version of browsers display **Punycode**, an ASCII encoded version of unicode
		- `www.xn--pypal-4ve.com`

![website properties](http://snag.gy/8jrZs.jpg)

## Social networking sites

- Flickr, Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn and Twitter all encourage communication
- Easy to use for information gathering attacks
	- Why search through a letterbox when you can create a profile online
	- People tend to publicly post what they are doing, when, with whom
	- This can lead to identity theft, fraud or harassment

### Facebook

- Users can write their own applications
- Many applications are interactive and highly dynamic and execute in user browsers
- Many of these applications go unscrutinized
- Of 14,000 applications examined, 20% contained malware
- This can lead to malware, spam and ads
- See http://infosecisland.com/blogview/9829-One-in-Five-Facebook-Applications-Contain-Malware.html

### Creepy software

- Software that maps out tweets, Flickr images, Facebook posts etc.
- See https://youtu.be/JqJ4zaDIVAs

## Concluding remarks

- Privacy and computer technologies
	- So much to cover
	- So little time
- This lecture barely scratches the surface of this issue
- Hopefully it has enlightened at least some of privacy issues raised by the use of modern computer technologies

>You have zero privacy anyway - get over it

-- Scott McNealy, CEO Sun Microsystems, 1995
