# Tutorial 8: Operating system security

## 1

For what are the following components of the Windows security architecture responsible?

- SAM
- SRM
- Security descriptors
- Tokens
- EFS

### Answer

- Security Accounts Manager (SAM)
	- A database that stores user accounts and relevant security information about local users and groups
	- Stores users' passwords in hashed format
- Security Reference Monitor (SRM)
	- Determines if a process has the appropriate rights to perform an action
- Security descriptors
	- Part of NTFS file system
		- Each NTFS file associated with a security descriptor
	- Acts as container for security Token of the owner of the file
- Tokens
	- After a user is authenticated, access tokens are issued to user accounts by Local Security Authority (LSA) which contain
		- User's individual Security Identifier (SID)
		- User's group Security Identifier (SID)
		- Local system rights
	- Token is used to access objects via the Security Reference Monitor (SRM)
	- In order to access an NTFS file, Security Reference Monitor (SRM) compares tokens of users to the file's Access Control List (ACL) to determine if access is allowed

Research and define the following models of security:

- Bell-LaPadula
- Biba
- Clark-Wilson

### Answer

#### Bell-LaPadula

(Manocha, 1999)

- Deals with control of information flow
- "Linear non-discretionary model"
- Consists of:
	- Set of subjects
	- Set of objects
	- Access control matrix
- Security levels
	- Each subject has maximum clearance level
		- Subject can access lower clearance levels but cannot go higher than max
	- Each object has classification
		- Classification is attached to a security level
- Access rights for subjects
	- Read only
		- Subject can only read the object
	- Append
		- Subject can only write to object but cannot read
	- Execute
		- The subject can execute the object but cannot read or write
	- Read-write
		- The subject has both read and write permissions to the object
- Control attribute
	- Given to the subject that creates an object
	- Creator of object can assign any of the access rights above of their object to any subject
		- However it cannot pass the control attribute itself
	- The creator of the object is also known as the controller of that object
- Restrictions
	- Reading down
		- A subject has only read access to objects whose security level is below the subject's clearance level
			- Prevents subject from accessing information available in higher security levels that the subject's clearance level
	- Writing uo
		- A subject has append access to objects whose security level is higher than its current clearance level
			- Prevents subject from passing information to levels lower than its current level
- Supplement
	- The Bell-Lapadula model supplements the access matrix with above restrictions to provide access control and information flow
		- If a subject has read access to an object in the access matrix, it might still not be able to exercise this right if the object is at a security level higher than the subject's clearance level
- Operations
	- `get access`: Initiates access to object (read, append, execute etc.)
	- `release access`: Gives up initiated access
	- `rescind access`: Controller of an object can revoke a designated access to that object from a subject
	- `create object`: Activates an inactive object
	- `delete object`: Deactivates an inactive object
	- `change security level`: Changes clearance level of a subject below an initially assigned value
	- Note: Certain conditions must be satisfied before any of above operations can be performed
		- ie. Subject can perform `get access` and `rescind access` to an object only if it has control attributes to that object

(Maniscalchi, 2010)

- Developed in 1970s for US Military by David Bell and Leonard LaPadula of Mitre Corporation
- Developed in response to information leakage
- Concentrates on protecting information from flowing in wrong direction
	- Categorised as an Information-Flow model
- Is a Hierarchical State Machine Model
	- Many layers (lattice)
	- Maintains a secure state
		- Each rule is security preserving
		- Transactions proceed only if the system moves from its existing secure state to another secure state
- Three access rules
	- Dominance relation
		- The clearance level of a user (subject) maps to the classification of files (object)
		- Users with particular clearance will only be able to access files of a particular classification and below
	- Discretionary security
		- Specific users are granted specific modes of access
	- Data flows upwards
		- Data can only move up the lattice from lower levels of classification to higher
- First model to define three fundamental modes of access
	- Read
	- Write
	- Read/write
- Users cannot be assigned more than one access mode
- Security properties
	- Simple security property
		- Users can read data of a lower classification
	- Star security property
		- Users can write data to an area of higher classification
	- Strong star (tranquility) property
		- Users can read and write to own level only

#### Biba

(Maniscalchi, 2010)

- Focuses on data integrity
- Concerned with preventing data from low integrity environments polluting high integrity data
- Security properties
	- Simple integirty property
		- Data can be read from a higher integrity level
	- Star integrity property
		- Data can be written to a lower integrity level
	- Invocation property
		- User cannot request service (invoke) from a higher integrity level
- Opposite of BLP
	- BLP is WURD model
		- Write up read down
	- Biba is RUWD model
		- Read up write down

#### Clark-Wilson integrity model

- Builds on BLP and Biba
- Introduces concept of a program arbitrating a subjects access to an object in an access triple
	- A relationship of subject, program and object
- Three integrity goals
	- Preventing unauthorised users from making any modifications
	- Preventing authorised users from making unauthorised modifications
	- Maintaining internal and external consistency
- Only permits modificationm of data if that modification meets the three integrity goals above

#### Lipner 1982

(Maniscalchi, 2010)

- Combination of BLP and Biba forms the basis of Windows NT security model

Open source operating systems such as Linux are more secure than closed source (commercial) systems such as Windows 8. This is a great exam question. What is your view on this issue? Do you agree or disagree? Do some research on arguments for and against the statement.

### Open vs. closed

(Basha, 2001)

(Iyengar, Sachdev, & Raja, 2007)

- Open
	- Pros
		- Less market share
			- Less likely to be targeted by attackers
		- Transparent
			- Source code available to anyone
		- More people can debug
		- More frequent patching of vulnerabilities
		- Not hindered by schedule or monetary obstacles
		- Support from community
		- Free
	- Cons
		- Less control over code
		- Anyone can make alterations
		- Could potentially lead to backdoors
			- Although community would report straight away
- Closed
	- Pros
		- Unified experience
		- Less confusion for customers
		- More profitable
		- More control over code
	- Cons
		- Large amount of market share
			- Targeted by attackers more frequently than open source counterparts
		- Can only be debugged by employees/contractors
		- Costs time and money
			- May not be priority of company
		- Have to wait until company releases patch for product to resolve vulnerabilities
		- Cost of product

Describe a good solution to the problem of having a group of students collaborate on a software construction project using the directory of one of the group members in such a way that it would be difficult for non-members to discover and would not require the help from a system administrator, assuming that the only access rights the group leader can modify are those for `\everyone."`

You may assume that access rights for directories are `\read,"\write,"` and `\exec,"` where `\read"` means the files and subdirectories in that directory can be listed, `\write"` means members of that directory can be inserted, deleted, or renamed, and `\exec"` on a directory or subdirectory means the user can change his location to that directory or subdirectory so long as he specifies its exact name.
