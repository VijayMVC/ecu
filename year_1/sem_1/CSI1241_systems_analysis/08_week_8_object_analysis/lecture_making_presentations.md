# Making presentations

## Introduction

- Presentations are part of the skill set of a systems analyst
- In the past, presentations have used overhead projectors, blackboardss etc.
	- These days, computer-based data projectors are easily the most popular

## Audience

- Who is your audience?
- What do they know?
- What terminology will the know and not know?
- Why are they attending the presentation?
- How can you make it easy for them to get the message?

## Purpose

- There may be many reasons for an analyst to give a presentation:
	- To make a proposal
	- To conduct a walkthrough
	- To provide training
- The purpose of the presentation will determine the content and how you cover it
	- Here we will assume we are making a proposal

## Preparation

- Plan the logic of the presentation
- Design the presentation around the *3T* system
	- Tell them what you're going to say
	- Tell them
	- Tell them what you've just said
- Allocate time to each part of the presentation based on importance and need
- Allow time for questions and answers
- Practice, practice, practice

## Slide design

- Use a simple slide design
	- Objective is to get your message across, not distract the audience by the design
- 6 points to a slide maximum
- Keywords and phrases rather than sentences
- Use examples to make clear
- Tables and diagrams OK
- Use these sparingly to avoid distraction
	- Colour
	- Animations
	- Slide connectors
	- Audio

## Giving the presentation

- Make sure the audience can see and hear you
	- Watch where you stand
- Be friendly but professional
	- Some humor is good but not too much
- Eye contact with audience
	- Don't face the screen or computer
- Try not to appear nervous
	- Hide your hands
- Don't read the slide word for word
	- Elaborate from the keywords to explain your point
	- Don't use notes
- If you must, use a pointer or laser
- Pace your presentation
	- Don't rush it
- OK to walk around a little, keeps attention

## Question time

- Be prepared to geet unexpected questions
	- It's not possible to predict every question
- Try to answer questions honestly and analytically
	- By yourself, good to have whiteboard or flipchart ready to help answer questions
- Good to have backup slides with further detail that you weren't able to use in presentation itself

## Dealing with questions

- Listen carefully to the question
- Pause to think your answer through
- If necessary repeat the question to the questioner to confirm your understanding
- Answer the question that was asked or say "I'll get back to you"
- Check with questioner that you have answered the question

## Review

	- Tell them what you're going to say
	- Tell them
	- Tell them what you've just said

	- 6 points maximum
- List 3 points to remember when dealing with questions
	- Listen carefully to the question
	- Pause to think your answer through
	- Check with questioner that you have answered the question
