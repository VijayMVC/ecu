Questions for Priya:
  ☐ Are we specifying requirements for an iOS app or the whole system, or both?
    Initially understood that the whole system is to be built since the case study states "provide them with a system that tracks details..." and   that the iOS app is an after thought that company may want at some point down the track due to wording "considering". But after reading the assignment deliverables again, it feels like an iOS app will be expected.
  ☐ I am the only person active in my group.
    After we received the case study, all communication stopped except from Adam. He is in China at the moment, and says has done some work but has not had the chance to update our Dropbox. All other group members have not responded to 3 of my emails over the last 2-3 weeks. The last email I sent reminded them of our obligations on the contract but again, no response from anyone except Adam.
    I am trying to lead the group and encourage contributions but not getting anywhere at the moment. What do you suggest?
  ☐ Are those deliverables outlined in the assignment due on their corresponding weeks and need to be submitted? Or are they a guideline to ensure that we stay on track.
    If they are to be submitted, should we submit our requirements document as a whole, or those sections individually?
  ☐ Distribution list: I understand normally this would be filled with names of stakeholders, managers and anyone involved in approving the project.
    Who are the stakeholders in this situation?
  ☐ What is the referencing for?
    Are we expecting to cite papers or textbooks for this assignment? 
  ☐ Would you mind taking a look at the draft in its current state?
