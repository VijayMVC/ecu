# 1.0INTRODUCTION

One paragraph. Describe the problem and the likely benefits (for the client) of this system.

Cryo Cell Corporation (CCC) wants to develop a mobile application that will enable clients and staff to perform a number of key tasks through their Apple iOS devices. Development of the application offers CCC a number of potential benefits by improving overall customer satisfaction and building the brand. The application will provide better support and improve accessibility for clients. It has the potential to improve sales by exposing clients to additional services provided by CCC. It also has the potential to increase cash flow by improving the turnaround time on invoice payment. The application also offers benefits internally by improving staff efficiency and reducing the administrative load.

Existing CCC clients will be able to view services, check sample status, request sample destruction, pay invoices and send enquiries, while CCC staff will be able to search for samples, retrieve client details and examine audit records. The application will be developed using the Corona SDK which will allow future versions of the application to support Android devices.

Use case:        **Log in to application**

Actor(s):Client, CCC Employee

Purpose:    This use case allows both Clients and CCC Employee users to log in to the application.

Overview:    Client or CCC Employee enters account details which is then authenticated by the system. If the details are correct, the system identifies the user type and provides access to the application according to the user's type.

Preconditions:Client or CCC Employee is logged out of the application and is attempting to log in.

Postconditions:    Client or CCC Employee is logged in to the system and is provided access according to their user type.

Typical Course of Events

| Actor Action | System Response |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Client or CCC Employee enters account detailsExtension point: Reset password | 2. System authenticates detailsInclude: Authenticate user |
|  | 3. If details are correct, system identifies user type, either Client or CCC Employee |
|  | 4. System signs in Client or CCC Employee to application according to user type |

Alternative Courses

- .Step 1: User may choose to reset password, go to reset password use case
- .Step 3: If Client or CCC Employee details are incorrect and fails authentication, display message "Incorrect username and password", go to Step 1. After 3 failed authentication attempts, use case ends.

Related Use Cases

Inclusions: Authenticate user

Extensions: Reset password

## 5.2ELABORATION OF SEARCH CLIENT DETAILS USE CASE

Use case:        **Search Client Details**

Purpose:    This use case allows the Client account manager to search for client account details on the iOS application.

Overview:    Client account manager enters client search query then system displays search results. Client account manager views client data and the system logs user actions

Preconditions:Client account manager has logged in successfully to the application and wishes to search for client information.

Postconditions:    Client account manager locates and views client data, and user activity is logged by CCC internal audit system.

|  | 5. System logs Client account manager username/accountID, timestamp, access type and accessed client accountID |
|  | 6. System sends logged data to CCC internal audit system_Include: Log user actions_ |

Alternative Courses

- .Step 1: Client account manager cancels search, end use case.
- .Step 2: Search query provides zero results, system displays message "No results found", return to step 1, end use case.

This use case concludes (or ends) when the client either cancels the viewing of their invoice, or once the client selects the option to pay the invoice.

Preconditions:The client has logged in to their account successfully.

The client selects the option to view their current invoice.

Postconditions:    Client is returned to the previous screen or viewing the payment options in the "Pay Invoice" use case.

Typical Course of Events

| --- | --- |
| 1. Client selects the option to view their invoice | 2. System displays most recent invoice |
|  | 3. If an outstanding balance exists, system provides customer option to pay the invoice |
| 4. Client chooses to pay invoice Extension Point: Pay Invoice |  |

Alternative Courses
