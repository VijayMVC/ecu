  Agenda:
    ☐ Discuss CCC case study
      Questions etc.
      Does everyone agree with requirements so far
    ☐ Check assignment outline and list of deliverables, due dates
      Need to stick to this to stay on track
    ☐ Cover the individual tasks, each person needs to submit:
      - One elaborated use case diagram each, due Week 7
      - One app screen each, due Week 9
        ☐ Decide on who is doing the start screen
      - One business rule diagram each, due Week 11
      - One corresponding event specification table each, due Week 11
    ☐ Who is responsible for Section 1.0: Introduction
    ☐ Who is responsible for Section 3.0: Project Scope
    ☐ Formatting
      Use Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3 and numbered lists. Leave red remarks there until submission
      Need to stick to format so that numbering and TOC is generated automatically.
      ☐ Track changes so we can see what's been added or deleted
    ☐ Don't forget to log changes in the Modification History
    ☐ Does simultaneous editing work well in Word?
      Should we just stick to separate sections each to avoid deleting or overwriting each others work
    ☐ How are we going to check that stuff is getting done?
      Maybe with that weekly update that is in our team contract
