  Notes:
    Fine tune requirements, assumptions.
    Introduction, Scope -> Adam

    Make updates on separate file, someone will be responsible for updating the main file.
    Use headings to mark out where updates should go.
    Description and name 

    Use case diagram, split up functional requirements, will be shared amongst team to complete and then joined up together at the end.
    Functional requirements to be confirmed first.

    Frank added assumption and intro

    Adam: Confirm functional and non-functional before moving on to Case Diagram

    Preferred email catch-up rather than Skype

    By Friday close of business, we will have Section 1.0 - 3.2 shown to Priya

    Ask Priya about individual deliverables, send in source document or send through separately.
  
  Minutes:
    ​1. To avoid formatting dramas, we agreed that the master draft file should be updated by one person. I've nominated myself to maintain the file. All updates are to be made on a separate file in the Dropbox folder, and will be updated to the master draft file. Please include the following information:
        - The section that you are updating
        - Your name
        - A brief description of what you've done (I'll add this to the Modification History with your name and date)
        - Flick me an email when you've got an update ready to go and I'll add it to the master file straight away

    2. Take some time to read the Case Study, and the current Functional and Non-functional requirements and make sure you are happy with what we have. This section will be submitted to Priya for feedback by COB 29-AUG so please review it by then.

    3. We agreed that 3.3 Out of Scope Items and 4.0 Assumptions sections need to be fleshed out more.

    4. The objective this week is to send the Functional and Non-functional requirements to Priya for feedback by COB 29-AUG. Adam will be looking into completing 1.0 Introduction (which Frank has made a start on) and 3.0 Project Scope.

    5. The next section due will be the Case Study Diagram. Once we have Priya's feedback, we have agreed to split the requirements up so each team member will be responsible for a part of the Diagram. Then we'll stitch them together into one Diagram when we're done.

    6. Confirmation from Priya required for the "per team member" deliverables. Do we include these into the document itself or submit them separately? We can add this to the email when we send our Functional/Non-functional requirements for feedback.

    7. We agreed that Skype might not be the best way to catch up on a weekly basis, hassle getting everyone online at the same time. We agreed to provide regular updates on email, although less frequent Skype catch ups will be necessary down the track.

    8. Thanks Frank for getting a start on the Introduction and additions to the Assumptions. Don't forget to log your changes to the Modification History so your contributions are recorded.
