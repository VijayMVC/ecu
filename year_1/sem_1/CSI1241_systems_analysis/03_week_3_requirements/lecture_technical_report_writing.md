# Technical report writing

## Business standards

- Templates
- Executive summary
- Formatting
- Use of diagrams, tables
- Concise language

## Templates

Many technical reports have a standard template to follow. For example, you will be provided with standard templates for documenting minutes of meetings. Templates usually provide section headings for you to follow. If you are given one of these, you must follow it.

However, just because you follow the template headings, doesn't make it a good report.

## Executive summary

An executive summary is a summary for the busy executive to read. It should summarise the report in an interesting way, highlighting important aspects that will motivate the executive to read further. If you don't do this, the executive may decide not to read any further.

## Formatting

If you are not given a precise format to follow, you should construct one that you think is appropriate.

Consistency here is important. In other words, the style you adopt needs to be consistent throughout.

- Heading style
- Bold, underlining, italics
- Line spacing and gaps between sections
- Page numbering, headers and footers
- Section numbering

Learn to use the heading facilities that Word provides.

## Diagrams and tables

Diagrams and tables are a good way of summarising complex data. Good reports would contain diagrams and tables used appropriately.

Learn how to create useful, meaningful diagrams and tables in Word and Excel and how to import them into reports.

Use legends and learn how to number diagrams and tables properly. See ECU guidelines.

## Concise language

It is important to use appropriate language in a report.

Consider:

- Be concise
- Avoid colloquial language
- Use technical terms only when necessary
- Always define terms

## Audience

- Who is your audience?
- What do they know?
- What terminology will the know and not know?
- Why are they reading your report?
- How can you make it easy for them to get the message?

## Good writing practice

Good writing is about communicating to your reader what you have done as well as well-designed paragraphs and a well-structured assignment.

At university, good writing can make the difference between passing or failing an assignment or a project.

If you do not write well, you may lose the reader. At university, the reader is your lecturer who awards you your marks.

## What is good communication

- What is the purpose of the document?
- Are you summarising a topic, or are you criticising what you have done, how you went about it or why you did it?
- Who is your readership? 
	- What will they know and not know?

## Planning techniques

- Consider planning the overall logical structure of your report using:
	- Breakdown structure
	- Mind map

### Breakdown structure

The same principle applies to a report and sections within a report.

### Mind map

A more complex report.

## Section content

- Each section is broken up into a number of paragraphs
- There should be a flow of argument between each paragraph
- Each section should have an introductory and conclusion/summary paragaraph

### Define the logic in each section

## Paragraphs

- What makes a good paragraph?
- Unity
	- Discuss only one main idea in a paragaraph
	- Each supporting sentence should develop that main idea
- Coherence
	- Supporting sentences are in logical order
	- Ideas connected through use of transition signals
- First sentence
	- States main idea or theme of paragraph
	- Scopes what can be discussed in paragraph
	- Stimulates reader interest
- Supporting sentence
	- Develop the theme of the paragraph
	- Provide explanations, justifications, evidence etc.
	- Logical flow of argument
- Concluding sentence
	- Signals end of paragraph
	- Leaves reader with points to remember

## Quiz

Take the next paragraph and draw a breakdown structure of the logical structure of the paragraph.

>Gold, a precious metal, is prized for two important characteristics.  First of all, gold has a lustrous beauty that is resistant to corrosion.  Gold never needs to be polished and will remain beautiful forever.  For example, a Macedonian coin remains as untarnished today as the day it was minted twenty three centuries ago.  Another important characteristic of gold is its usefulness to industry and science.  For many years it has been used in hundreds of industrial applications.  The most recent use of gold is in astronautsâ€™ suits.  Astronauts wear gold-plated heat shields for protection outside the spaceship.  In conclusion, gold is treasured not only for its beauty, but also for its utility.

## Referencing and plagiarism

- Referencing and plagiarism have been discussed elsewhere
- Technical reports should contain references and for all work at ECU should follow the ECU guidelines
- The rules for plagiarism apply to technical reports

## Review

- Why is it important to know about your audience?
	- So you can make assumptions about what they do/don't know, and whether or not they will understand some terminology, or will need a more thorough explanation
- Why is it important to think about what they know and don't know?
	- To determine how detailed the writing must be
- What two characteristics are in a good paragraph?
	- Unity
		- Discusses only one main idea
		- Each supporting sentence should develop that idea
	- Coherence
		- Supporting sentences are in a logical order
		- Ideas connected through transition signals
- What is the structure of a well written paragraph?
	- First sentence
		- Introduces main idea or theme of paragraph
		- Defines scope
		- Stimulates interest
	- Supporting sentences
		- Develops theme
		- Provides explanation, justification and evidence
		- Logical flow of argument
