The purpose of this paper is to help students prepare for the examination.

The exam paper is 2 hours long with 5 minutes reading time. It is closed book and so no reading materials are allowed.

There are two sections.

## Section A

Section A is worth 20 marks. All questions are compulsory, ie. there is no choice. The questions are simple recall questions that are taken straight from the lecture notes. Each question is worth one mark. For example, a question might be:

Define systemic development.

The questions in this section are all multiple choice.

The questions in this section are all taken from a databank of questions that you have seen in the reivew sections of your lecture notes. For your convenience, this databank is listed here below.

## Section B

Section B is worth 30 marks. All questions are compulsory. The vast majority of questions are worth 2.5 or sometimes 5 marks and are designed to test your ability to perform the techniques you have covered during this unit.

The list of techniques you may be asked to perform is taken from the following:

- Business process workflows
- Use case diagram
- Elaborated use case
- Business rules diagram
- Elementary data dictionary
- Composite data dictionary
- Data model navigation
- Webpage design
- Conceptual object model
- Object life history
- State precedence map
- Logical relational data model
- Normalisation
- User interface design
- Navigation map

In any one exam, it would be usual for about half or just a little more than half of the above techniques to be tested but bear in mind that since there is no choice, it would not be wise to assume that certain topics will come up. Also, occasionally in this section you may be asked a reflective question about what you have done. For example, you may be asked questions such as "what are the difficulties in conceptual object modelling?" or "what are the difficulties in logical relational data modelling?".
