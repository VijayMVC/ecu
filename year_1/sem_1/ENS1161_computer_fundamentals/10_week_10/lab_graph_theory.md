## Question 2

Six teams P, Q, R, S, T and U play in a competition in which each team plays every other team exactly once. So far eight matches have been played:

- P-R
- P-S
- P-T
- Q-S
- Q-U
- R-S
- R-U
- T-U

Use a graph and its complements to find which matches have not yet been played

Yet to play:

- P-Q
- P-U
- Q-R
- Q-T
- R-T
- S-T
- S-U

## Question 3

![q3-1](http://snag.gy/zDeD9.jpg)

### 2: How many edges should there be in K<sub>7</sub>?

21

### 3: How many edges will there be in a complete graph on:

#### 5 vertices

10

#### 6 vertices

15

#### *n* vertices

edges = 1/2 * n * (n-1)
