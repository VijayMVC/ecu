# Relations

## Relations Between Sets

- Relations between sets form the basis for relational databases and similar structures, which are widely used for the storage and retrieval of data
- We shall admit our discussions to so called binary relations and different ways of representing binary relations
- A relation between two sets is a subset of their **Cartesian product**
- Recall that if `A` and `B` are sets, then their **Cartesian product** `A × B` is the set of all ordered pairs `(a, b)` where `a ∈ A` and `b ∈ B`
- A relation `R` between `A` and `B` is a subset of `A × B`
	- There are usually many possible relations between two sets

### Example: Students taking courses

- `S = {Andrew, Betty, Chris, Dianne}` is a set of students
- `C = {CS101, CS102, CS103}` is a set of computer science courses

There are many ways of showing which students are taking which courses.
