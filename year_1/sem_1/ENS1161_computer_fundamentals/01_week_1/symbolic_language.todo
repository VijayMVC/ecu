  ‚òê Question 9 on page 2 - Tutorial Exercises Set 1: 2014-07-29 22:27
    Suzie applied for a position on the next Antarctic expedition. You could get a place if you were a qualified mechanic or a biologist. She didn't have the necessary training. What conclusion can we draw? 
      The answer is: 
        She was not a mechanic and she was not a biologist. Or, more concisely 'she was neither a mechanic nor a biologist'.
      **But the question never specified which training she didn't have.** Challenge the answer.
