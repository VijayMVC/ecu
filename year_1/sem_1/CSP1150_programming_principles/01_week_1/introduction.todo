Lecture Tasks:
  ☐ Recreate diagrams on pp. 6

Clarification required:
  ☐ Procedural Programming pp. 28: Confirm what it means when data formats might change. Does that mean int to String for example?
  ☐ Is it ok to use a different IDE? I already have Eclipse installed and used to how it works.
  ☐ I was under the impression that a main method is always required. But in the tutorial example, the method is called `print` instead.
