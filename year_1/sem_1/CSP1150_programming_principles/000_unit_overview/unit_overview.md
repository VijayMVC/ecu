# Unit Overview #

This unit provides an introduction to the principles of computer programming, program design, development and testing, data types, classes, objects and methods, inheritance and graphics. These principles are taught using the Java language.

You do not require any previous programming experience to undertake this unit - just a desire to learn and a willingness to commit time each week. Most people find that programming is fun but requires discipline - and there is no substitute for constant practice. If you keep up with the unit materials each week you will succeed.
