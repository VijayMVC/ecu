## Variables

My study is multivariate, there are multiple variables for each experimental unit.

## Variable scales

### Ratio scale

Describes a variable whose numerical values truly indicate the quantity being measured.

#### Characteristics

- There is a true 0 point
	- For example, length of lizards cannot have a negative length
- An increase of the same numerical amount indicates the same quantity across the range of measurements
	- For example, a 2cm and a 40cm long lizard will have grown the same amount if they both increase in length by 10cm
- A particular ratio holds across the range of the variable
	- For example, a 40cm long lizard is twenty times longer than a 2cm lizard, and a 100cm long lizard is also twenty times longer than a 5cm lizard

### Interval scale

Describes a variable that can be less than 0.

#### Characteristics

- The 0 point is arbitrary
	- For example, temperature can have values that are less than 0 degrees.
- An increase of the same numerical amount indicates the same quantity across the range of measurements
	- For example, a 2*C increase indicates the same increase in heat whatever the starting temperature
- Since the 0 point is arbitrary, a particular ratio does not hold across the range of the variable
	- For example, the ratio of 6*C compared to 1*C is not the same as 60*C to 10*C, the two ratios in terms of the kelvin scale are 279 : 274 K and 333 : 283 K

#### My variables that are in interval scale

None

### Ordinal scale

Applies to data where values are ranked, which is when they are given a value that simply indicates their relative order. The ranks do not necessarily indicate constant differences. For example, five children of the ages of 2, 7, 9, 10 and 16 years have been aged on a ratio scale. If you rank these ages in order from younges to oldest, which will give them ranks of 1 to 5., the data has been reduced to ordinal scale. Child 2 is not necessarily twice as old as Child 1.

#### My variables that are in interval scale

- Sociability?

### Nominal scale

Applies to data where the values are classified according to an attribute. For example, if there are only two possible forms of coat colour in mice, then a sample of mice can be subdivided into the numbers within each of these two attributes.

Nominal scale data can only be discrete, since they are attributes.

#### My variables that are in nominal scale

- Gender

## Continuous and discrete data

- Ratio, interval and ordinal data can be either continuous or discrete data
- Nominal data can only be discrete

### Continuous data

Can have any value within a range. For example any value of temperature is possible within the range from 10*C to 20*C, ie. 15.3*C to 17.82*C.

#### My continuous data

None

### Discrete data

Can only have fixed numerical values within a range. For example, the number of offspring produced increases from one fixed whole number to the next because its not possible to have half or a quarter of an offspring.
