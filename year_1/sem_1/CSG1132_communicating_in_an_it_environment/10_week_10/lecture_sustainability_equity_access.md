# Sustainability, equity and access

## What is ethics?

- A branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct (Fieser, 2009)
- Behaviour may be ethically wrong, but legal
	- Think of examples
- A study of moral behaviour in humans and how they should act
- Applied ethics is the study of ethics in real world situations

## Ethics in ICT

- Software engineering
	- Quality management
		- Software testing
			- Known errors in software go un-addressed
	- Applications that do harm
- Privacy and confidentiality
	- Actions that infringe privacy and violate confidentiality
- Un-ethical business practice
	- Under shooting or low-balling, and under delivering
	- Collusion
	- Price gauging
	- Exploiting client ignorance

## Class activity

- Review the following case study in software engineering
	- [McFarland, S. J. (2012). Occidental Engineering Case Study: Part 1](http://www.onlineethics.org/Resources/Cases/OccidentalEng.aspx)
	- Decide for yourself if you think software engineer Wayne Davidson's decision to sign off on the air traffic control software was *ethical*
		- Give reasons

## Sustainability

> The idea of "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs"  
- World Commision on Environment and Development, 1987

- More recently defined by the idea of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) where an organisation demonstrates sustainability via environmental performance, economic performance and social performance

### Sustainability in action

- Reducing the carbon footprint of IT infrastructure
	- Energy consumption of server farms and data centres
- Reducing the carbon footprint of organisations by reducing emissions and waste
	- Video conferencing vs. face to face
- Reducing pollution
	- Reducing E-waste through component recycling
	- Reducing or removing toxic chemicals from components and landfill
	- Reducing emissions from backup power generation

### Case study: Microsoft

- Cheap electrical power attracted Microsoft to rural Grant Counting in Washington State
- In 2006, it built a data centre that relied on backup diesel generators for business continuity
- Extensive use resulted in particulate pollution
- Power bills for residents soared as server farms used up electricity production and created local shortages
- See [nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/technology/data-centers-in-rural-washington-state-gobble-power.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&)

### Greening IT

- Gartner estimates that data centres account for between 1.1% and 1.5% of the world's total energy use in 2010
	- Decide if the following technologies are green positive or negative
		- Algorithmic efficiency
		- Virtualization
		- SSD

## Accessibility

According to W3C, web accessibility means:

>That people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can contribute to the Web. Web accessibility also benefits others, including older people with changing abilities due to aging.

- Impairments that affect Web accessibility include:
	- Blindness / Visual impairment
	- Deafness
	- Physical handicap
	- As little as 3% of websites may be fully accessible

### Why accessibility?

- 1 in 5 Australians experience long term impairment
	- 3.95 million people
- 2.6 million of people with disabilities are under the age of 65
	- Equates to 15% if the <65 population
- 86% of people with disability report a core limitation
	- ie. Mobility, communication, restriction in schooling or employment
- The right thing to do
- Leads to good practice in Web design
- Reduces legal risk
	- Some degree of compliance is mandatory
		- WCAG 1.0, WCAG 2.0

### Common accessibility issues

- Images in web pages without ALT tags
- Links requiring a mouse or equivalent pointing device
	- Unsupported by keyboard
- Missing heading tags in HTML that describe read order
- Formats that do not support read aloud screen readers, ie. PDF
	- Acrobat 7-9 very limited support
	- Acrobat X-XI improved support
		- Has "ake accessible" wizard

## Equity

- Equity is about fairness
	- Equity derives from a concept of social justice
	- It represents a belief that there are some things which people should have
	- There are basic needs that should be fulfilled
	- Burdens and rewards should not be spread too divergently across the community
	- Policy should be directed with impartiality
	- Fairness and justice towards these ends
- Equity issues in ICT include
	- Equity of access to ICT infrastructure and services
	- Information literacy that enables digital citizenship
	- Gender equity

### Infrastructure and services

- Location and geography have shaped access to services
	- Regional and rural users mostly have inferior internet compared to suburban users
	- Idea of the Community Service Obligation evolved as
- Lower SES groups have issues of affordability with fixed line and mobile services
	- Australia is a middle ranking country in terms of affordability

### Information and ICT literacy

- Disadvantage may also grow from infromation and ICT literacy
- Social groups experience information and ICT illiteracy in different ways
	- Literacies need to be investigated with respect to different socail groups, and their specific needs
	- Take age, gender, class, ethnicity, disabilities and minority status into account

### Gender equity

- Range of issues including
	- Under representation in ICT workforce
		- In 2010, females comprised 23.31% of the Australian ICT workforce
		- Gender proliferation in lower paid jobs
	- Gender pay gap

## Conclusions

- Professional practice needs to be aligned with ethical conduct
- In ICT, decisions with ethical consequences can be seen in software engineering, the handling of private and confidential information, and in business practices
- Sustainability means development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs
- Applications include reducing the carbon footprint of ICT and organisations, reducing toxic waste and pollution
- Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and that they can contribute to the Web
	- Web accessibility also benefits others, including older people with changing abilities due to aging
- Equity is about fairness and social justice
- Issues include
	- Equity of access to ICT infrastructure and services
	- Information literacy that enables digital citizenship
	- Gender equity
- ICT that takes into account issues of equity and access is likely to be more sustainable in the long run
