# Statistical literacy 3

## Introduction

Statistical literacy is about understanding and evaluating statistics. This workshop will revist descriptive methods for measuring centrality and variability using the data set for Assignment 2. You will also create the Research Questions (RQs) and Thesis Statements that will drive your investigation of the data set that you will report upon in Assignment 2.

## Activity 1 - Thesis statements and dataset

### Thesis Statements

In Assignment 1b, you selected a Facebook topic area drawn from the Facebook user psychology research literature selected from:

- Facebook addiction
- Role of age and/or gender
- Role of introversion/extraversion
- Role of self-esteem and/or anxiety
- Facebook as an enabler of social inclusion

Review your literature review and topic area. Next download the Facebook dataset found in this week's workshop:

>Assignment_2_dataset.xlsx

Note: The dataset is also available in spss format.

### Understanding the Facebook user dataset

In the Facebook worksheet, review the hyperlinked explanations of data columns appearing in the spreadsheet. Write the names of variables that relate to your selected topic area in the space below and explain why they are imported

For example:

>Topic: Role of self-esteem in Facebook use

>- Variables:
	- Facebook hours per week
		- Measures a user's engagement in terms of active hours per week
	- Facebook logins
		- Another measure of user engagement
	- Self-esteem
		- Use may be linked to self-esteem
	- Facebook friends
	- Social Anxiety
	- Sociability

### My topic

Role of gender in Facebook use

#### My variables

- Sex
	- Determines gender
- Facebook logins
	- Measures user engagement differences between genders
- Facebook hours
	- Measures user engagement differences between genders
- Facebook friends
	- Measures network size difference between genders
- Close friends
	- Compares offline network to online network difference between genders
- Sociability
	- Compares sociability differences between genders

## Activity 2 - Research questions

Thesis statements describe testable propositions that relate to RQs of interest. The following examples illustrate how to:

1. Define research questions and thesis statements
2. Work with the dataset

It is recommended that you devise and test at least two thesis statements in your theme area for Assignment 2. Use your themed literature review and the dataset to guide your formation of Research Questions and thesis statements.

For example:

>**Theme 1:** Facebook use and self esteem  
**Research question:** Is Facebook use related to user self-esteem?  
**Thesis statement:** Facebook hours are negatively related to user self-esteem on the Rosenberg scale  
**Explanation:** The research literature suggests a possible significant relationship between Facebook use and a user's self-esteem as measured on the Rosenberg scale  
**Problem solving:** Your work with the excel user data will focus on the relationship between Facebook hours and user self-esteem on the Rosenberg scale. Options include descriptives for both variables, histograms, scatter plots and results of association testing. Do the stats workshops and review the additional sources described under *Resources*

>**Theme 2:** Role of age  
**Research question:** Is Facebook use related to age?  
**Thesis statement:** Facebook hours are related to user age  
**Explanation:** The research literature contains different positions on the relationship between age and Facebook use. Originally, younger people were found to be more intensive users. Recently, an older demographic has taken up Facebook.  
**Problem solving:** Your work with excel user data will focus on the relationship between Facebook hours and age. Options include descriptives for both variables, histograms, scatter plots and results of association testing

Now write your Research Questions and thesis statements below. At least one RQ and thesis statement must be of your own creation:

### My theme 1

#### Research question

Is gender related to size of a user's Facebook network?

#### Thesis statement

Gender is related to the size of a user's Facebook network

### My theme 2

#### Research question

Is gender related to intensity of Facebook use?

#### Thesis statement

Gender is related to the intensity of Facebook use

### Variables

- Gender and Facebook network size
	- Gender
	- Facebook friends
	- Close friends
	- Sociability
- Gender and intensity of Facebook use
	- Gender
	- Facebook logins
	- Facebook hours

## Activity 3 - Centrality and variability

One of the most fundamental questions that we want to as of data concerns central tendency, or alternatively, variability. To help understand these ideas, read Chapter 3 from Welkowitz and Brook's (2012) *Introductory Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences*.

>Cohen, B., Welkowitz, J., Brooke, L. (2012) Introductory Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences. Hoboken : John Wiley & Sons, 2012.

Provide definitions of each of the following common measures of central tendency and variability.

- Mean
	- The average score
	- Usage pros
		- It takes all scores into account, makes the most of information provided
		- Most stable of measures of central tendency
		- Most suitable measure of central tendency
	- Usage cons
		- Extreme scores can influence mean
		- If distribution is highly skewed and when you do not intend to use the measure of central tendency in subsequent analysis, consider an alternative to the mean that is not affected by unbalanced extreme scores, like the median
- Median
	- The middle score
	- 50th percentile
		- Half the scores in he distribution are larger than the median
		- Half the scores in the distribution are smaller than the median
	- When distribution of scores is symmetric, the median and mean will be equal
	- In positively skewed distribution
		- Where there are extreme values at the higher end
		- The mean will be pulled upwards by the extreme high scores and will be higher than the median
	- In negatively skewed distribution
		- Where the extreme values are at the lower end
		- The mean will be pulled downard by the extreme low scores and will be lower than the median
	- Usage
		- Use the median when either the data are highly skewed
		- Or there are inexact data at the extremes of the distribution
- Mode
	- The score that occurs the most often
- Std. Dev
	- A measure of how spread out the numbers are
- Skew
	- Positive skew
		- When there are scores that are extremely high relative to the rest of the scores
	- Negative skew
		- When there are scores that are extremely low relative to the rest of the scores
- Kurtosis
	- The measure of the peak of the distribution, and how high the distribution is around the mean

### Notes

- Central tendency
	- A single number that describes the general location of a set of scores
	- An important attribute of a set of scores is its location
		- Where in the possible range between minus infinity and plus infinity the scores tend to fall
	- Can be described by the mean or median
		- Median is used when the scores are skewed

## Activity 4 - Centrality and variablity

Now for the variables you selected in Activity 1, describe the summary stats in the Facebook workshop.
