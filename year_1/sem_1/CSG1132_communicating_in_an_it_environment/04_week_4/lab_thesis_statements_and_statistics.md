# Thesis Statements and Statistics

## Writing your own thesis statements

In modules 2-3, you began to familiarise yourself with some of the literature on Facebook user psychology:

- Anderson, B., Fagan, P., Woodnutt, T., & Chamorro-Premuzic, T. (2012). Facebook psychology: Popular questions answered by research. Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 1(1), 23-37. doi:10.1037/a0026452
- Facebook profiles capture true personality, according to new psychology research (2009). NewsRX.
- Haydon, J. (2013). Facebook marketing for dummies. Hoboken: Wiley.
- Lambert, A. (2013). Intimacy and friendship on facebook. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.

Recall from this week's lecture that there are three kinds of thesis statements:

- Argumentation
- Analysis
- Exposition

See if you can develop examples of each based on the reading you have done.

The following readings in the Readings folder for week 4 provide a good introduction to writing well constructed thesis statements.

- Tagg, J. (2004). The thesis statement. The Discovering Ideas Handbook. Palomar College. Retrieved March 1, 2010.
- University of Wisconsin-Madison. (2009). Developing a thesis statement. The Writing Centre. Retrieved March 3, 2010.

### Answer

- Argumentative
	- Social networking sites do not replace other computer mediated communication technologies
- Analysis
	- Personalities are predicators to Facebook use
- Exposition
	- Facebook use leads to smartphone addiction

## Statements, questions and data gathering

Whether variables such as gender and age are predictive of Facebook use is a question you may have encountered while investigating the literature.

Here is an example of an analysis type thesis statement that might be tested with the data set:

>Facebook use is related to gender

- What research question might have inspired this statement?
	- Is Facebook use different between men and women?
- Why would such question be of interest to anyone?
	- For marketing implications, determining target audience and/or methods to reach wider audience
- What data would you gather to test your thesis statement?
	- User data
	- Gender data
	- Hours data
	- Access data
- How would you collect this data?
	- Survey

In the real world of research, taking a **construct** such as 'use', and expressing it as a **parameter** or **variable**, is called **operationalization**. In the research proper, variables are measured and values are analysed to see if they are consistent with the thesis statement or otherwise.

Two variables that might be used to operationalize and measure FB use are logins and hours spent online in Facebook.

- Which is more reliable and why?
	- Logins. Depending on how data is logged, a user may be logged in but idle making hours spent an innaccurate variable. Time provided could also be estimations, whereas logins are concrete numbers.
- Generate one or more Facebook thesis statements of your own that relate to *user psychology*, based on your reading.
	- Social networking sites do not replace other computer mediated communication technologies
	- Personalities are predicators to Facebook use
	- Facebook satisfies fundamental need for self-worth
- What data would you collect to enable testing of your statement?
	- Login data
	- Survey
	- Personality test

## Measuring centrality with scale data

In the second assignment in CSG1132, you will be writing a research report based on analysis of some Facebook user behaviour and psychology. The analysis is based on a data set that describes Facebook user behaviour including:

- Facebook user behaviour in terms of logins per week and estimated time spent on Facebook
- Facebook user estimates of Facebook friends and 'close friends' ie. close or intimate friendships across all the models in which friendship ties exist, not just Facebook
- Facebook user self-estimates of social connection as an interval scale measure
- Facebook user performance on a scale of introversion vs. extraversion

Create formulas to determine the following values in the spreadsheet:

- Mean
	- Average
- Median
	- Middle value
- Mode
	- Most commonly occuring
- Std. Dev.
	- Amount of variation or dispersion from the average
	- Less than half of average indicates low variability
- Skew
- Kurtosis
- Max

Similar mean, median and mode values indicate good central tendency
