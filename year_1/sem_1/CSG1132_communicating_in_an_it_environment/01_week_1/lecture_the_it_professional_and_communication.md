topic: user motivation - social media/networking
case study: facebook

user motivation occurs in human computer interaction (hci)
solution providers live or die professionally according to whether your system is accepted or rejected by users
ie. myspace vs facebook, yahoo vs google.
love or hate facebook:
- what factors promote or detract from user acceptance and motivation
- how do we prove such relationship scientifically?
for example, connection to size of social network vs patterns of user use.
facebook use is related to network size etc.

why are we doing this unit?

ict professionals fail at communication for both written and oral communication.
- business cases
- customer relations
need good comms to win the arguement.

** task - watch it crowd video: write a list of keywords that describe how it workers are framed.
** answer: selfish, inconsiderate, can't be bothered, condescending, nerds, too technical, speaks another language, short-tempered.

brilliant engineer vs brilliant communicator = wozniak vs steve jobs. who do we remember?

** task - watch steve jobs 2005 stanford commencement address: review video, decide whether jobs was effective as communicator and why. ie shaping message to event or audience, implying medium effectively, using gesture and tone, underlying reality - personal honesty. What does "stay hungry stay foolish" mean, and what does it mean for good career in ICT?

** answer: Effective because the content was relevant to his audience. Used comic irony to engage attention and appeal to rebellious spirit of college students. Split speach in 3 short parts, making it easier to digest and have 3 clear messages. Used personal, down to earth stories that anyone could relate to.

Stay hungry, stay foolish: Always set goals, don't settle for the current status quo, don't censor yourself when coming up with ideas.




Argumentation

Form of communication to persuade with effective reasoning, based on three components:
- logic: effective reasoning
- rhetoric: art of oral persuasion
- dialectic: contest of ideas
date back to aristotle and plato.

Medium is the message:
McLuhan coined the phrase "the medium is the message to convey how communication channels shape messages"
Is it any different communicating in a virtual environment? How?

** task - watch the virtual revolution video: write down keywords that describes these differences. Describe implications flowing from these differences for communication. ie sms chat style writing. dumbed down society "de-evolution" What does the image of monkeys infront of computers mean?

Why do we need effective communication:
- solve problems
- establish relationships and make connections - physical and conceptual
- self affirmation and validation, feel good about ourselves
- create understandings
- disseminate information, understanding and knowledge.

** task - which of these fits in a University environment? decide in your group, feedback to lecture group, online students leave feedback on discussion forum 1.



Understanding messages involves more than words

- how we say it, tone
- how we present ourselves, body language
- how we smell (to a dog, pheromones denoting fear, anxiety)
- prior learning, experiences

** task - watch 

** task - in your group, what is missing from communications that utilise a virtual environment. do humans interpret messages and react in a similar way to animals? Add feedback to week 1 discussion forum.
describe possible issues and influences ie gender, age, nationality - language barrier etc.



Noise - impedes effective communication

- distorts meaning of meaning intended by source
- syntactic noise produces technical distortion of messages
- semantic noise distorts the meaning of the message (interpretation and understanding). May be brought about by lack of communication skills, knowledge, attitudes or cultural differences
- we will looking at techniques to reduce the samntic noise of your communications

Skills - Information Literacy

- knowing the right questions to ask to solve an information need
- knowing how to use all the information tools available to meet this need
- being able to identify good quality, relevant information
- knowing the scope and boundaries of information systems
- being able to collate, manage, interpret, analyse and understand this information
- so that it may be reused to create new information that becomes part of your knowledge base

** task - are you an information literate person? if so, what makes you literate? what areas exist for improvement. Add feedback to Week 1 discussion forum.
