### Calculating the Distribution of Facebook Hours and Friends

#### Background

In Module 4, we saw how centrality and dispersion in data can be measured using methods such as:

- Median
	- Average
	- `=AVERAGE(array1, array2)`
- Mean
	- Middle score
	- `=MEDIAN(array1, array2)`
- Mode
	- Most frequently occuring
	- `=MODE(array1, array2)`
- Standard deviation
	- Average distance from Mean
	- `=STDEV.S(array1, array2)
- Skew
	- The degree of asymmetry of a distribution around its Mean
	- `=SKEW(array1, array2)`
- Kurtosis
	- The relative peakedness or flatness of a distribution compared with the Normal Distribution
	- `=KURT(array1, array2)`
- Max
	- Returns the largest value in a set of values
	- `=MAX(array1, array2)`

Often when working with numbers, datasets are large involving many observations or measurements. Analysing and interpreting data requires methods that enable us to take a simpler view of the data based ont he idea of aggregation, ie. constructing a summary description. As this week's e-book explains, one way of making a dataset more comprehensible is to write down every possible score value in numerical order and record next to each score, the value of times that the score occurs for a variable. This is called **frequency distribution**. The frequency distribution of a range of scores, is commonly used to make a judgement about normal or abnormal distribution of data.

Frequency distributions can be regular (in which each instance of a score falling within a range is counted) or cumulative (in which score frequencies are calculated cumulatively relative to the frequency of all scores). For example, the regular frequency of students scoring in the range 50-59 in an exam might be 5. Which means 5 students had exam scores in the range 50-59. In the same exam, 0 students scored between 0-9, 1 between 10-19, 0 between 20-29, 3 between 30-39, and 5 between 5-49. The cumulative frequency of scores 50-59 is 14. The interval used to calculate the frequencies is called the class interval.

#### Tasks

1. Read chapter 2 of the [Welokwitz](http://library.ecu.edu.au/record=b2214320~S1) text entitled "Frequency distribution and graphs"
	- Provides a good foundation in the idea of frequency distribution
2. Review [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c11d3vVM5v8) video: What is a "Standard Normal Distribution"
	- Introduction to properties such as distribution
3. Review [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXj4Q0jhLsI) video: Excel Statistics 01 - Creating a Frequency Distribution and Histogram
	- Introduction to Excel skills required to construct a frequency histogram to verify if a dataset is normally distributed
4. Copy the FB Hours data from Week 4 sheet to Week 5 sheet
	- Calculate the frequency distribution of data based on class intervals of 10 hours
	- Create additional frequency distributions for FB friends and logins
5. By plotting the data in a chart we can visualize the distribution of the data and compare the shape of the distribution with normal distribution
	- Is the data normally distributed for the variables from Task 4?
	- How would you describe the distribution?
	- Is it normally or non-normally distributed?
