## Focus questions

- Is self-affirmation the reason why people spend time on Facebook?
- Are Facebook profiles self-affirming in the sense of satisfying user's fundamental need for self-worth and self-integrity?
- Do users capitalize on Facebook's self-affirmational qualities by seeking it out for the purpose of ego repair?
- Facebook profiles have potential to confer upon users self-affirmation benefits because they encapsulate a flattering, socially connected, meaningful and accurate self-portrait

## Notes

- Self-affirmation theory (Steele, 1988) can be used to explain popularity of SNS
- SNS satisfies fundamental ego needs regarding desired self-images by allowing users to:
	- Create and customize profiles that display core aspects of self-concept
	- Highlight social connections with friends and family

### Ego Needs (fits under antecedents to use, along with "Values")

- Need for positive self-image
	- People dismiss, distort, or avoid information that threatens their self-worth
	- People value, cultivate, gravitate toward information that reinforces it
- Self-affirmation
	- Bringing to awareness essential aspects of the self-concept
		- Values
		- Meaningful relationships
		- Cherished personal characteristics (Sherman & Cohen, 2006; Steele, 1988)
- People are motivated to self-affirmation process after an ego threat
	- Unconsciously attempt to repair sense of self-worth
	- Defensive processes reduced because self-affirmation process has already reinforced sense of self-worth
		- Defensive includes
			- Dismissal
			- Distortion
- Self-affirmation applies to Facebook
	- Connects users with friends, family, aquaintances
	- Users create detailed profiles describing
		- Activities
		- Interests
		- Values
		- Articulate friendships with other users
	- Communication can be public
	- Activities on Facebook represent aspects of self
	- Facebook can be a venue for self-affirmation
- Facebook profiles
	- Facebook self-presentation involves displaying
		- Social roles
		- Affiliation to networks important to self-concept
		- Central attitudes and preferences (politics, religion, favourite music)
		- Social connectedness with friends and family, the most potent source of self-affirmation (Sherman & Cohen, 2006)
	- Facebook self-presentation can result in high levels of disclosure
		- 82% of Facebook users revealed highly personal information (Gross & Acquisti, 2005)
			- Birth date
			- Political orientation
			- Sexual orientation
			- Name of their relationship partner
		- Disclosure of private information is what makes SNS useful (Tufekci, 2008)
	- Facebook profiles offer positive and desirable self-presentation (Walther, 2007)
		- Ability to select and edit statements (editability)
			- Allows users to delete objectionable posts made by friends
			- Allows users to terminate friendship connection if no longer desired
			- Messages from friends posted on Facebook are usually warm, supportive, and validating (Sas, Dix, Hart, & Su, 2009)
		- Unlimited time to edit and customize profile and message (asynchronicity)
		- SNS technology allow online communication to be optimized, highly desirable self-presentations (Toma, Hancock & Ellison, 2008)
	- Self-affirming profiles must be accurate
		- Facebook governed by restrains that minimize deception
			- Friends who know presenter both offline and online can verify
			- Less likely to lie if chance of getting caught
		- Profile information on Facebook is contributed by friends
			- User has less control
			- Friends posts are testament of friendship
				- Reliable indicator of social connectivity (Donath & Boyd, 2004)
		- Accurate to enable reliable personality judgements (Back et al., 2010)

## Study 1

>Are Facebook profiles self-affirming in the sense of satisfying user's fundamental need for self-worth and self-integrity?

- Study 1 proves that Facebook profile exposure is a self-affirming activity
- Self-affirmation earned from Facebook does not differ from offline self-affirmation earning activities
- Exposure to Facebook profile increases self-worth and self-integrity
- Spending time on Facebook fulfills ego needs by showcasing a version of self that is attractive, successful and embedded in a network of meaningful relationshops and enhances user's perception of self-worth

## Study 2

>Do users spontaneously seek out Facebook for the purpose of validating and reinforcing self-worth on their own? Do they capitalize on the benefits provided by Facebook profile in time of psychological need?

- Self-affirmation theory suggests that perceived ego threats will trigger a response to seek self-affirming information in the environment
- Study 2 provides evidence that Facebook users gravitate toward their profiles after experiencing psychological distress, in an unconscious effort to improve perception of self-worth
- Supports proposition of self-affirmation theory that people are motivated to maintain elevated perceptions of self-worth and self-integrity by unconsciously seeking self-affirming activities in the environment

## General Discussion

- Self-affirming qualities could be one reason why Facebook use is widespread
- Facebook self-affirmation characteristics are consistent with self-affirmation theory
- Facebook is sought unconsciously
- Facebook profile browsing soothes ego threats that are unrelated to Facebook content
- Related theories that make claims about people's ego needs and the means to serve them
	- Self-affirmation theory
	- Self-verification theory (Swann, Rentfrow, & Guinn, 2003)
	- Symbolic self-completion theory (Harmon-Jones, Schmeichel, & Harmon-Jones, 2009)
	- The self-esteem evaluation (SEM) model (TZesser & Cornell, 1991)
	- Implicit self-esteem compensation (Rudman, Dohn, & Fairchild, 2007)
	- Social comparison (Festinger, 1954)
	- Cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957)

- Motivations of use
