## Focus questions

>1. Extraversion will be related to Facebook usage such that more extroverted users will report spending more time on Facebook, use it more frequently, have more Facebook friends, more frequently post information on their walls, post more photos, and engage in more self-generated wall postings, and report less regret over what they post.
2. Agreeableness will be related to Facebook usage such that more agreeable users will use Facebook less frequently, make fewer wall postings about others and express more regret over their Facebook activity
3. Conscientousness will be negatively related to Facebook usage such that people higher in conscientiousness will spend less time on Facebook, use it less frequently, have fewer friends, post fewer pictures, make fewer wall postings and express more regret
4. Emotional stability will be negatively related to Facebook usage such that people higher in emotional stability will spend less time on Facebook, use it less frequently, have fewer friends and express less regret, but positively related to Facebook content; ie. people higher in emotional stability will post more pictures and a greater number of self-generated wall postings
5. Openness to new experience will be positively related to Facebook usage such that people higher in openness will spend more time on Facebook, use it more frequently, and initiate more self-generated wall postings, than people low in openness, but will be negatively related to regret


## Notes

### Introduction

- Gender differences (Correa et al., 2010; Hamburger & Ben-Artzi, 2000)
- Check out (Amichai-Hamburger & Vinitzky, 2010 **Amichai-Hamburger2010**)
- 20% of Facebook users reported posting information that they would not want employers to see
	- Males more likely than females to post questionable comments or pictures

### Personality and Facebook

#### Extraversion

- Two competing explanations
	- Social compensation explanation, introverts would have the most to gain from the use of social networks like Facebook and can take advantage of indirect communication for lack of interpersonal skills
	- "Rich-get-richer" (Ong et al., 2010) explain that extraverts benefit more from Facebook since it provides another platform for them to communicate with friends and contacts made offline
- Personality a good predictor of internet usage motives (Amiel & Sargent, 2004)

#### Conscientiousness

- Conscientious individuals that do not believe Facebook will not drive efficiency or production, they will have decreased behavioural intentions towards it (Devaraj et al., 2008)
- Will not invest resources into Facebook, prefer to stick to main goals by avoiding distraction (Wehrli, 2008)

#### Emotional stability / Neuroticisim

- Negatively associated with social relationships (Wehrli, 2008)
- Positively related to amount of time spent online (McElroy et al., 2007)
- Individuals high in Neuroticism spend more time on SNS to try to make themselves look as attractive as possible (Wherli, 2008)

#### Openness to experience

- Individuals high on openness are more willing to consider alternative methods of communication like SNS (Ross et al., 2009)
- High on openness predicts more personal information being disclosed (Amichai-Hamburger & Vinitzky, 2010)
