- Personality characterized by Five-Factor Model (FFM) (McCrae, 1992)
- NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R) (Costa & McCrae, 1992) used to assess FFM
- SNS could be used to
	- Find others with similar interests
	- For romantic or social purposes (McKenna et al., 2002)
	- Maintain pre-existing social connections (Ellison et al., 2007)
- Relationships forged through SNS may be stronger than face-to-face (McKenna et al., 2002)
	- Different rules govern online interactions
	- Online interactions generate more self disclosures (Tidwell & Walther, 2002)
	- Allowed to ask deeper more personal questions without offending receiver (Tidwell & Walther, 2002)
- Most of Facebook friends were known from face-to-face relationships (McKenna et al., 2002)
	- Since most Facebook friends were known from offline world, privacy is not primary concern
	- Allows for more personal information to be divulged in order to have more offline friends find them (Ellison et al., 2007)
