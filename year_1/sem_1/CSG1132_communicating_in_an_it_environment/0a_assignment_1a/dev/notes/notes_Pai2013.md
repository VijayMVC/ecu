	- Response from others
	- Uploading pictures
	- Interactive games
	- Keeping in contact
	- Keeping company with friends
- Hedonism value second highest
- Most significant values to Facebook users are belonging and hedonism

#### Belonging

- Reflects human need to communicate and cooperate with others
- Users appreciate ability to share personal info through SNS
	- Uploading pictures
	- Instant messaging
	- Playing games
- Reinforces offline behaviour
- Peer pressure

#### Hedonism

	- Sense of uniqueness
	- Attempts to add interest to attract others to browse profile
		- Through gossip
		- Current minor events of daily life
		- Humerous anectdotes
- Browsing others' pages

#### Self-Esteem

- Gain self publicity
- Status enhancement (Flanagin & Metzger, 2001)
	- Feel important
	- Impress people
- Self presentation on Facebook different to other online communities

>"Facebook selves appear as highly socially desirable entities that users aspire to have offline but have not yet been able to embody" (Zhao, Grasmuck & Martin, 2008)

#### Reciprocity

- The desire to give back
- Level of trust develops in reciprocal interactions on Facebook
- Could relate to offline-online relationship
- Deceptive behaviour is greater in face-to-face than in computer mediated communication (Lewis & George, 2008)
	- Face-to-face allows for immediate reaction if deception is questioned
	- Online communication does not allow for immediate reaction to maintain trust and reinforcement of truth bias

### Ethical considerations

- Employer surveillance
- Privacy and information control
	- Tagged in photos by others
	- Not only what user does, but what user does to friends
- People have expectations about what information is appropriate to collect and whether it should be distributed
	- Information may be appropriate for sharing among a group of friends, but not open to other Facebook friends outside the group
- Using information that has been marked as private for marketing purposes
- Publicly private vs. privately public (Lange, 2008)
	- Publicly private
		- User identity is revealed
		- Content is privately and not widely accessed
	- Privately public
		- Sharing widely accessable content with many viewers
		- Limiting access to detailed information about user's identities

### Implications

#### Theoretical

- Respondents viewed asynchronous media is more enjoyable than face-to-face communication
	- Without losing interactivity and desirable presence of others
- Prefer SNS over blogs and other types of online communication tools
	- Has replaced other communication media
- The following gratifications are requirements for SNS users(Flanagin & Metzger, 2001; Katz et al., 1974)
	- Need for social integration (belonging)
	- Need for help in acheiving goals (reciprocity)
	- Need for status enhancement (self-esteem)
	- Need for entertainment (hedonism)
