## Focus questions

- Everyone will spend more time looking at the Facebook pages of people about the same age as themselves. Older people should be under less pressure to do so and will exhibit less interest in same-sex peers and more interest in family
- There will be more interest in looking at the pages of same-sex others vs. opposite sex others, will be stronger in females
- Females, compared to males will spend more time on activities related to impression management with their profile pictures
- Females will also spend more time looking at the photos of other people
- Males will spend more time looking at items on the pages of others' that reflect an individuals status or prestige; Educational background, work/career information, number of Facebook friends
- People not currently in a relationship will spend less time looking at the pages of same-sex others (assuming hetero)
- People not currently in a relationship will expend more effort at impression management via their Facebook profile pictures than those in a committed relationship

## Notes

	- Had more friends

- Age negatively related to most types of Facebook activity

## Discussion

- Men who were in a committed relationship spent less time looking at the pages of women and less time posting, looking at or commenting on photos
	- Women were not affected by their relationship status 
	- Contradicts with findings that men are more interested in casual sex than women
	- Could be because men in relationship have less time and are not seeking relationships with women
	- Does not explain why women do not show same pattern
	- Calls for more research
- People not in a committed relationship worried abit more about self-presentation via profile picture
	- True for females as much as males
- Relationship with age
	- Older people spent less time on Facebook
	- Had fewer friends
	- Generally did less of everything
