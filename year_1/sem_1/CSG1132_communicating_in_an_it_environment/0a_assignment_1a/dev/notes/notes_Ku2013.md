## Focus questions

- What are the gratifications sought from the use of Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) technologies?
- Are there general or specific gratifications sought across the use of different CMC technologies?
- What are the motives that drive people's choice of different CMC technology use?

## Notes

- Four general gratifications were taken from IM, SNS, and Email
	- Relationship maintenance
	- Information seeking
	- Amusement
	- Style
- IM & SNS
	- Sociability
- IM
	- Killing time

## Introduction

- Studies indicate CMC technology does not replace old technology
	- Each CMC tech satisfies needs that another CMC type cannot completely fulfill
- Other studies look at how people choose CMC technology (Chen, Yen, & Hung, 2004; D'Ambra, Rice, & O'Connor, 1998; Hiltz & Johnson, 1990; Hung, Huang, Yen, & Chang, 2007; Mennecke, Valacich, & Wheeler, 2000; Shirani, Tafti, & Affisco, 1999)
	- Media-richness theory
		- Based on technology features
		- Assumes that people tend to use the richer CMC technology because it includes more cues to enhance communication performance
			- Example, IM outperforms Email (Hung et al., 2007)
	- Task-technology Fit (TTF) theory	
		- Based on contingency
		- Selection of CMC is contingent on task which is intended to be performed
			- Example, users can enhance productivity by using the CMC tech whose features fit the task characteristics

## U&G Theory

- Grouped into two concepts (Palmgreen, Wenner, & Rayburn, 1980)
	- Gratification sought
		- User expectation before the use
	- Gratification gained
		- User experience while using
