# What is a concept map

- Graphical tools for structuring and representing knowledge
- Feed off ideas of the constructivist learning movement and Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning
- Within framework, concept maps are used for stimulating the establishment of relationships among concepts and for the generation of ideas
- Constitutes an excellent breeding ground for the construction of new and more elaborate knowledge
- Rodriguez-Priego et al., (2013) call this "Path labelling".
- Rodriguez-Priego et al., (2013) state that although concepts maps are hierarchical, all concepts "are equally represented"
	- (might not add this) and label the structure as "concept layering".
