# What is a concept map

# Why we use concept maps as a thinking and organisational tool

- Hwang, Shi and Chu (2011) cite that concept maps have proven to assist in meaningful learning (Horton et al., 1993; Trent, Pernell, Mungai & Chimedza, 1998).
- Studies by Hwang, Shi and Chu (2011) show that "with the help of the collaborative Mindtool (concept map), the learning achievement of the students was significantly better than for those who learned with the other approaches".
