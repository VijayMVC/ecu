# What is a concept map

- "Concept mapping is a method of graphically representing concepts and their interrelations"
- "Nodes represent concepts and labelled links represent relations between concepts"
- "Based on Ausebel's assimilation theory of cognitive learning"
- "Concept maps visualize the heirarchy and relationships of concepts"
- "Through the construction of a concept map, meaningful learning can be assisted (Novak, 1990)"


# Why we use concept mapping as a thinking and organisational tool

- "Concept maps can assist the preparation of lessons and the sequence of topics presented"
- "Serve as a basis for discussions"
- "Used as a tool for knowledge evaluation"
- "Can assist from learning from text" which is the focus of article
- Hilbert & Renkl (2009) state that students who utilise concept maps during research "performed better than, for example, students who used underlining (Amer, 1994), note-taking (Reader & Hammond, 1994)"
