# What is a concept map

- Developed in 1972 by researchers at Cornell University (Novak & Canas, 2006)
- A concept map is a tool to visually organise and present knowledge, usually in reference to a focus question (Novak & Canas, 2006).
- Anatomy of concept map
	- Concepts inside bubbles or "nodes"
	- Associated concepts are linked with lines
	- Lines are labelled to express relationships between concepts
		- Unlike mind maps where there are no labels for relationships 
- Structure of concept map
	- Hierarchical
	- General concepts at the top
	- Most specific concepts towards the bottom
	- Non-linear, not restricted to linking concepts within a domain
		- Able to cross-link and display relationships between separate domains within the topic
		- Cross-links demonstrate deeper understanding, and synthesis of new contexts within the topic, expressing relationships that might not be immediately evident

# Why we use concept mapping as a thinking and organisational tool

- According to Novak & Canas (2006, pp. 1), a concept map "serves as a kind of *template* or *scaffold* to help organize knowledge and to structure it". The display of this "scaffold" or foundation also assists in identifying knowledge gaps in domains where further research could be gathered.
- Due to the structure and the way information is presented on concept maps, they define the scope of the topic to be researched. 
- Concept maps display information in an organised, non-linear and scaleable way which allow new ideas to be easilly connected to pre-existing knowledge and assist in organising information as they are found during research
- As cited by Novak & Canas (2006, pp. 1), concept maps assist in "the retention of knowledge for long periods of time (Novak, 1990; Novak & Wandersee, 1991)" due to the utilisation of iconic memory (Novak & Canas, 2006; Sperling, 1960; 1963).
