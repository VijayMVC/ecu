\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Motivational differences between genders}

\citet{Fallows2005} compared American male and female Internet users and found that men were more likely to use the Internet in general for information gathering purposes, while women were more likely to use the Internet for social applications to maintain current relationships. According to the literature in this review, this statement also translates to the use of SNS.

Widely cited research by \citet{Raacke2008} was among the first to examine the impact of SNS on college students and found that men, compared to women, were more likely to use SNS to find out about events, while \citet{Mazman2011} and \citet{Muscanell2012} both assert that women were more likely to seek out old friends on the network, and are more likely to utilise SNS communication tools to maintain existing relationships. In contrast, men were found to use SNS more as a tool to create new relationships and expand their networks \citep{Mazman2011}.

It is worth noting however, that studies by \citet{Raacke2008} and \citet{Muscanell2012} were based on participants from a single US college comprised of undergraduate students who provided self-reported estimates, which will be a recurring limitation in this literature review. Interestingly, \citet{Raacke2008} gathered data from respondents via paper questionnaires, as opposed to \citetapos{Mazman2011} and \citetapos{Muscanell2012} online questionnaire method. Online questionnaires have the potential to skew results towards users who may spend more time online, possibly use SNS more, and have higher competency in SNS use, compared to those who spend less time online \citep{Hargittai2007}.

Men using Facebook for dating purposes more than women is a recurring theme in the literature reviewed \citep{Muscanell2012, Raacke2008, Haferkamp2012}, which supports a previous statement that men use SNS to create new relationships.



\subsubsection{Criticisms}
Competency as a variable is often overlooked in the literature within the scope of this review.
