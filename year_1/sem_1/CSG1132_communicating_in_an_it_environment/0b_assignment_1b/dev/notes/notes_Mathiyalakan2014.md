# Discussion and results

- Finding show men are less concerned about privacy in Facebook and with internet use in general

# My commentary

*About the content, how this might support my arguments.*

- Provides different approach to difference between male and female Facebook users
	- Examines privacy values and risk taking behaviours
- Even though small sample size, study indicates risk taking behaviours of men compared to women
- Supports Facebook use differs between men and women
- Will need to find study with larger sample size to back up claims
