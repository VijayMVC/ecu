# Notes

*Use keywords, phrases, dot points.*

- Key focus is to identify gender roles in Facebook impression management through the evaluation of profile and cover photos
- Uses "evolutionary psychology" (pp. 388)
	- "A theory which holds many assumptions regarding gender differences - to draw hypothesis" (pp. 388)
- Dataset is from random, public, international Facebook users
	- 500 users
- Found male profile photos to 
	- Emphasise status using objects or formal clothing
	- Express values of risk taking with photos in outdoor settings
- Found female photos to
	- Emphasise family
	- "Emotional expression" (pp. 338)
		- Eye contact
		- Smiling
		- No sunglasses
- Cover photos provided no correlation to gender differences
	- "[P]erhaps since they serve only as a supplement to the self-presentation that appears in the profile photos" (pp. 338)
- Background of evolutionary psychology
	- Men and women have evolved with different behaviours to adapt to different "challenges in the prehistoric past" through natural selection (pp. 389)
	- "Women may have adapted traits that were beneficial to childcare" (pp. 389)
		- Women may have a further evolved sense of empathy to raise children compared to men who may not have been as involved in "our ancestral past" (pp. 389)
- Study provides background to gender differences in evolutionary psychology in
	- Family relations
	- Status
	- Risk
	- Emotional expression

# Landmark

- Researcher only found one other study that related to gender roles in Facebook impression management (Hum et al., 2011)
	- This study did not identify any significant correlation between gender and Facebook impression management
	- Used "explorative hypotheses" that were not theory-based
- Did not use estimates
	- Sample data is from actual Facebook profiles

# Methods and sample

- Study completed in 2012 (pp. 391)
- 500 profile samples (pp. 391)
	- 198 (39.6%) females (pp. 391)
	- 302 (60.4%) males (pp. 391)
- Scoring tool which includes a 38 item checklist (pp. 391)
- Profile photo samples were chosen randomly through software [ImageCrashers](http://www.imagecrashers.com/) (pp. 391)
- Key variables
	- Gender
	- Age
	- Impression management
		- Family photos
			- Includes one adult with one or more children
			- Two opposite sex adults
				- Highlights fact that two opposite adults could be siblings or friends but claims that it is highly unlikely
		- Status
			- Photos with presence of objects
			- Photos with a person with formal dress style
		- Risk taking
			- Photos with at least one person in an outdoor setting
			- Photos with presence of drugs or alcohol
		- Emotional
			- Limited to photos with only one person
			- Eye contact
			- Smiling
			- Sunglasses
	- Facebook usage
		- Number of friends
		- Likes
		- Adoption of timeline
		- Disclosure data
			- Relationship status
			- Friends
			- Likes
			- DOB

# Discussion and results

- Photos
	- Male profile photos portrayed 
		- Status through use of objects and formal clothing
	- Female profile photos portrayed 
		- Family relations through family photos
		- Emotional expression through eye contact, smiling and lack of sunglasses
	- No significant difference in portrayal of alcohol or cigarettes between genders
		- Small sample of profile photos showing drugs (10/500) (pp. 392)
	- No significant difference between gender in use of cover photos
		- Only key difference is women are more likely to show a family photo compared to men
- Facebook usage
	- No difference between men and women in number of friends
	- Women more likely to post a cover photo in timeline format
	- No difference in disclosure of
		- Relationship status
		- DOB
		- Likes
- Discussion
	- Facebook serves as a platform for attracting mates, among other needs (Tosun, 2012)
	- Family relations
		- Compares the findings with study that explains women are more active in maintaining family relations (Salmon, 1999; Salmon & Daly, 1996)
		- Results are in line with McAndrew & Jeong (2012) where women appear more in family photos and spend more time looking at them
	- Status
		- Explains that men display notions of status in Facebook profile photos to appear more attractive to use Facebook which serves a need to attract mates
	- Risk
		- Males display photos in outdoor setting
	- Emotional expression	
		- "Suggests women express more emotion in Facebook profiles, hide less" (pp. 394)
		- "Men may tend to choose photos that illustrate their masculinity; hence less smiling" (pp. 394)
	- Facebook use
		- Photo impression management identified greater gender differences than the other usage data collected
		- Many studies with conflicting results (Acar, 2008; Bonds-Raacke & Raacke, 2010; Lewis, Kaufman, Gonzalez, Wimmer, & Christakis, 2008; McAn- drew & Jeong, 2012; Pempek et al., 2009)
- Limitations
	- Photo from profile may not be of the profile owner
	- Since profiles were chosen at random and without the knowledge of profile owner, could not confirm, however study explains it is highly unlikely that photo was not of profile owner


# My commentary

*About the content, how this might support my arguments.*

- Can use the two studies (Hum et al., 2011 and this one) to compare their approach
- Need to find other examples of evolutionary psychology used in Facebook research to back up this study
- Different approach
	- Examines differences between male and female Facebook users in their use of profile photos
	- Uses evolutionary psychology
	- Uses actual figures, not estimates from users through surveys
- See *Table 1, pp. 389* for a list of other research that explores gender differences in Facebook
- Can evolutionary psychology be applied to the other Facebook studies?
- Is there a difference between offline and online gender roles?
