# Notes

*Use keywords, phrases, dot points.*

- Key focus is to identify gender roles in Facebook impression management through the evaluation of profile and cover photos
- Uses "evolutionary psychology" (pp. 388)
	- "A theory which holds many assumptions regarding gender differences - to draw hypothesis" (pp. 388)
- Dataset is from random, public, international Facebook users
	- 500 users
- Found male profile photos to 
	- Emphasise status using objects or formal clothing
	- Express values of risk taking with photos in outdoor settings
- Found female photos to
	- Emphasise family
	- "Emotional expression" (pp. 338)
		- Eye contact
		- Smiling
		- No sunglasses
- Cover photos provided no correlation to gender differences
	- "[P]erhaps since they serve only as a supplement to the self-presentation that appears in the profile photos" (pp. 338)

# Landmark

- Researcher only found one other study that related to gender roles in Facebook impression management (Hum et al., 2011)
	- This study did not identify any significant correlation between gender and Facebook impression management
	- Used "explorative hypotheses" that were not theory-based

# My commentary

*About the content, how this might support my arguments.*

- Can use the two studies (Hum et al., 2011 and this one) to compare their approach
- Need to find other examples of evolutionary psychology used in Facebook research to back up this study

- Different approach
	- Examines differences between male and female Facebook users in their use of profile photos
