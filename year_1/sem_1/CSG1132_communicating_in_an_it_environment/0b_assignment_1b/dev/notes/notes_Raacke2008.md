# My commentary

*About the content, how this might support my arguments.*

- Use Weiser (2000) to provide background
- Study is old, 2008
- Provides more evidence to Fogel2009's findings that women are more concerned about privacy
- Links to X and X for men using Facebook for dating purposes
- Men having more friends than women may no longer be the case
	- Contradicted by McAndrew2012
- Limitations
	- Only college students were surveyed
	- Small number of non-users
