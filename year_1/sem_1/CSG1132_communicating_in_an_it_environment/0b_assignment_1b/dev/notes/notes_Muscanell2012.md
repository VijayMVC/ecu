# My commentary

*About the content, how this might support my arguments.*

- Men use SNS to create new relationships, women use it to maintain current relationships could be used to support Tifferet2014: Facebook used as a platform to attact mates
	- See quote that refers to Raacke & Bonds-Raacke (2008)
- Uses comscore for [Facebook](http://www.comscore.com/) analytics
- Check Peluchette & Karl 2008, reinforces Tifferet2014
- Claim about men using SNS to create new relationships while women use it to maintain current relationships contradicts findings that women send more friend requests in Facebook
