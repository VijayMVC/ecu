>An international sample of 1,026 Facebook users (284 males, 735 females; mean age = 30.24) completed an online survey about their Facebook activity. **pp. 2359**

===

>Females, younger people, and those not currently in a committed relationship were the most active Facebook users. **pp. 2359**

===

>Females spent more time on Facebook, had more Facebook friends, and were more likely to use profile pictures for impression management; women and older people engaged in more online family activity. **pp. 2359**

# Methods and sample

- To recruit Facebook users (pp. 2360 - 2361)
	- Used [Snowball sampling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_sampling)
	- Facebook event
	- Campus-wide emails
	- [Social Psychology Network](http://www.socialpsychology.org/) website
- Sample of 1026 users include (pp. 2361)
	- 284 male
	- 735 female
	- Age 18 - 79, mean 30.24 (SD = 11.99)
	- From 54 different nations
	- Countries with highest sample include
		- Germany
		- South Korea
		- UK
		- US largest group
	- 38% students
	- 60.2% non-students
	- 1.8% did not report status
- Data gathered via online survey
	- Based on estimates by user
	- Answer to questions based on 5 point scale
		- 1 being never, 5 being always
		- "Scale adapted from measure developed by Pempek et al. (2009)"
	- Usage hours per week and number of friends were estimates
	- Number of logins **not** obtained

## Test of predictions

>[T]here would be a strong overall preference for looking at the pages of same-sex others, and that this preference would be even stronger in females than in males. This prediction was only partially supported. **pp. 2362**

===

>[F]emales being significantly more likely to agree that they spent more time looking at the pages of same-sex others, F (1,816) = 101.80, p < .0001, gp2 = .111, M (SD) = 3.14 (.723) vs. 2.58 (.730). **pp. 2362**

===

>[F]emales being significantly more likely than males to use their profile picture for impression management, M (SD) = 2.40 (.639) vs. 2.13 (.658). **pp. 2362**

===

>The fourth prediction was that females would spend more time than males on photograph-related activity in general, apart from things that they do with their own profile pictures. This prediction was also supported in that females scored higher than males on the "Photo Activity" composite measure, F (1, 816) = 37.71, p < .0001, gp2 = .044, M (SD) = 3.05 (.689) vs. 2.70 (.689). **pp. 2362**

===

>The fifth prediction was that males should spend significantly more time looking at markers of achievement and status than do females. We found partial support for our prediction. **pp. 2362**

===

>[M]ales were significantly more likely to check the number of friends that their friends had, t (1012) = 2.53, p < .01, M (SD) = 1.97 (.972) vs. 1.81 (.919). **pp. 2362**

===

>Interestingly, females checked other individuals’ relationship status more often than did males, t (1009) = 2.58, p < .01, M (SD) = 2.51 (.979) vs. 2.34 (.963). **pp. 2362**

===

>The sixth prediction was supported. Those not currently in a relationship spent significantly less time looking at pages of same-sex others, F (1, 816) = 3.81, p < .05, gp2 = .005, M (SD) = 2.94 (.845) vs. 3.03 (.706). However, this effect was almost entirely due to the responses of males, as there was a significant interaction between sex and relationships status on this variable, F (1, 816) = 4.25, p < .04, gp2 = .005. Males who were not in a relationship spent less time looking at the pages of same-sex others than males in a relationship, but relationship status had no effect on the tendency of females to do so. **pp. 2362**

===

- More males **pp. 2363**
	- "Show serious expression" on profile picture
	- Replace a real photo with a photo of a cartoon character, celebrity or symbol
- More females
	- Have higher number of hours spent on Facebook
	- "Have a profile picture"
	- Spend more time looking at same-age others' profiles
	- "Seek personal information about others"
	- Directly interact with others
	- Use Facebook for family activities
- Age has effect on **pp. 2363** 
	- Facebook activity
		- Posting profile pictures
		- Number of hours per week

# Discussion and results

- Females compared to males (pp. 2364)
	- Demonstrated higher engagement in Facebook activity
	- Spent more time on Facebook
	- Had more Facebook friends
	- More interested in personal information about others
	- Viewed more pages of same-sex others
	- Displayed more effort in the presentation of their profile pictures
	- Viewed more photos of others
- Males compared to females (pp. 2364)
	- Are more interested in number of friends of others
- Study should have separated same-sex vs. opposite sex others

# My commentary

*About the content, how this might support my arguments.*

- Sample consists of international users
- Sample has considerably more females than males
- Data gathered from users are estimates, particularly hours per week
- Data does not include number of logins per day/week
- Is 5 point scale (Pempek et al., 2009) accurate enough?
- Raises interesting points about relationship status between males and females
	- Unfortunately cannot use, no relatable variables in upcoming dataset
