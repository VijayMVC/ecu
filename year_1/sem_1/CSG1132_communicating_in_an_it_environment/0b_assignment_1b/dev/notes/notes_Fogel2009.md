>Even when women are reassured about privacy protection and cre- ate a social networking profile, to maintain their sense of being protected by an acceptable implied social contract they are less likely than men to disclose identity information. **pp. 159**

===

>We also found that men were more likely than women to include their phone number on their profile. This could be because based upon our anecdotal expe- rience in face-to-face situations men are often more comfortable providing phone numbers to others than women. **pp. 159**

===

>we found that women were more likely to write on other people’s profiles than men. This may be because women like to share their thoughts and feelings by writing on other people’s "walls" as compared to men who use an instrumental relationship style, which includes a preference for doing activities together rather than expressing thoughts and feelings (Boneva, Kraut, & Frohlich, 2001). **pp. 159**

===

>In our study we also found that men have more "friends" on their profiles than women. We must first understand what the word "friend" means to each individual. **pp. 159**

>In our study, the women may care more about whom their "friends" really are and are more selective of whom they link to as a "friend" and who they can build a relationship with. **pp. 160**

===

>women may be more private when it comes to allowing strangers to become their "friends" as compared to men who are not as concerned and are comfortable with allowing strangers to become their friend and have access to their profile. Women might also be more afraid of stalking and of men making sex approaches if they include certain men as their "friends." **pp. 160**

# Methods and sample

- Uses social contract theory as framework
- 205 students from the same college
	- Participants approached within the college itself
- Survey, self-reporting, estimates from users
- Demographic variables
	- Age
	- Sex
	- College status
	- Ethnicity
- Use of SNS variables
	- Measures frequency of logins as well as time spent per day
	- Survey asks privacy related questions
		- Personal information disclosure
		- But no questions about privacy settings specifically
	- 5 point scale

# Discussion and results

- Men display more risk taking behaviour than women
- Women concerned more about privacy of information on the internet than men
- Interestingly no gender differences between privacy behaviour or attitudes
- Men disclosed more personal information than women
	- "indicating less concern with identity information disclosure on social networking communities" **pp. 157**
- Facebook more trustworthy than MySpace
	- No gender differences
- Men disclosed more personal information than women
- Women wrote on other people's profiles more than men
- Men had established SNS profiles longer than women
	- *Earlier adopters?*
	- *Can this be used to back up claims of higher risk taking in men?*
- Women view more profiles of others' compared to men
	- More evidence for McAndrew2012 and Choi2014
- Men had more SNS friends than women

# My commentary

*About the content, how this might support my arguments.*

- Survey did not ask about privacy settings specifically
- Survey uses somewhat abstract questions not completely related to SNS
	- For example "To achieve something in life, one has to take risks" **pp. 155**
- Sample includes people who are not SNS users
- Study shows that the men in the sample have had longer profiles on SNS than women
	- Are men earlier adopters than women?
	- Is it due to men being more prone to risk taking behaviour?
- Study result of women viewing more profiles of others'
	- Recurring theme
		- McAndrew2012
		- Choi2014
		- Fogel2009
- Study uses inclusion of "phone number" on profile as a personal information disclosure, however was not specific on whether or not it was landline or mobile
	- May have been interpreted as landline and answered no, when infact they had a mobile phone
- Dataset is limited to one college from one area
- Self-reporting surveys rather than observations or recording data
- Women more concerned about privacy linked to Raacke2008
