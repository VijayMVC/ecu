# Discussion and results

>the number of brand fan pages was positively correlated with Facebook activity (r = 0.30, p < 0.001), self-presentation (r = 0.21, p < 0.001), number of Facebook friends (r = 0.14, p < 0.01), and WOM on Facebook(r = 0.37, p < 0.001). **pp. 3**

===

>Facebook activity was positively correlated with self-presentation (r = 0.53, p < 0.001), number of Facebook friends(r = 0.35, p < 0.001), and WOM on Facebook (r = 0.20, p < 0.001). **pp. 3**

===

>self-presentation was positively correlated with number of Facebook friends (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and WOM on Facebook (r = 0.44, p < 0.001). **pp. 3**

===

>men are more likely to engage in brand-related WOM than women when users more actively engage in self-presentation activity. **pp. 4**

# My commentary

*About the content, how this might support my arguments.*

- Different approach
- Relates to Tifferet2014: male's tendency to express status through objects and formal wear
	- Could also use brand-related word-of-mouth as another means to express status
- Quote about women more likely to compare themselves with other people supports McAndrew2012: Women spend more time looking at profiles of same-age others
- Uses frequency of visits as well as time spent on Facebook as variable
- Could be a potential approach to explore the gender role of advertising on Facebook
