# Notes

*Use keywords, phrases, dot points.*

- Focus is on language used on Facebook and its relationship with demographics and personality
- Correlations and wordclouds can be viewed [here](http://www.wwbp.org/)
- Analyses "700 million words, phrases and topic instances from Facebook messages of 75,000 volunteers"
- Personality was also tested
- Found links between language and personality, gender and age
- Uses *open-vocabulary* technique
- Focuses on what people say and describes similarities or differences between demographics and personality
- States the proliferation of social media, large datasets can be gathered and "content is often personal and describes every day life" (pp. 2)

# Landmark

- Largest study of personality and language to date
	- "Small datasets do not express significant differences in language use other than for common words" (pp. 4)
- Open-vocabulary technique
- Includes phrases
- Word-cloud visualisation

# Quotes

*Include page numbers.*

>Here, we demonstrate an instrument which uniquely describes similarities and differences among groups of people in terms of their differential language use. **pp. 1**

===

>Our technique leverages what people say in social media to find distinctive words, phrases, and topics as functions of known attributes of people such as gender, age, location, or psychological
characteristics. **pp. 1**

# Methods and sample

- "Standard approach to relating language use with individual attributes is to examine usage of a *priori* fixed set of words" (pp. 1)
	- "Limits findings to preconceived relationships with words or categories" (pp. 1)
- This study "extracts a data-driven collection of *words*, *phrases*, and *topics*, in which the lexicon is based on the words of the text being analyzed" (pp. 1)
- "This yields a comprehensive description of the differences between groups of people for any given attribute, and allows one to find unexpected results" (pp. 1)
	- This approach is *open-vocabulary* as it does not have a dependency on a "*priori* word or category judgements" (pp. 1)
- Uses *differential language analysis* DLA
	- Identifies "language features that distinguish demographic and psychological attributes" (pp. 1)
- 15.4 million Facebook messages
- 75,000 volunteers
- Extracted 700 million instances of words, phrases and automatically generated topics
	- Compared with demographics and personality
- Performed traditional language analysis to compare results with their own findings through open-vocabulary technique

## Facebook status updates

- 19 million Facebook status updates
- 136,00 users
- Limited to 
	- Users under 65 years old
	- English as primary language
	- Previously written at least 1,000 words in status updates
	- Must indicate gender

		- "My girlfriend"

	- Huffaker et al. (getyear) found males use more emoticons than females
