>more than a billion monthly active users on Facebook alone (Facebook Newsroom, 2014) **pp. 165**

===

>Large scale surveys have found more females than males use
SNS. Hampton et al. (2011), for example, reported that 56% of SNS users were female, and Madden and Zickhur (2011), who reported females were not only more likely to use SNS, but were more likely to be daily visitors then males. **pp. 165**

===

>a number of studies have found that females spend more time on SNSs than males. Denti et al. (2012), reported that on average, females spend 84 min a day on Facebook, compared to 64 min for males, with similar figures obtained by Shambare and Mvula (2011), Moore and McElroy (2011). **pp. 165**

===

>females tending to use SNS for communicating and connecting with others, and males for gathering information (Denti et al., 2012; Junco, 2013; Smith, 2011). **pp. 165**

===

>One of the most consistent findings (and one with obvious parallels to differences in SNS use) is that females are more likely to use affiliative language (used for connecting to others), whereas males are more likely to use self-assertive language (used for dominance, and achieving practical goals). For a recent review see Leaper (2014). **pp. 165 - 166**
