# My commentary

*About the content, how this might support my arguments.*

- Most of the focus is on Facebook groups although does have one result relating to gender
- Women more likely to use Facebook Groups for obtaining information contradicts other research findings
	- But the study only examines Facebook Groups and not Facebook as a whole
