# Notes

*Use keywords, phrases, dot points.*

- Explores differences in people who use SNS to those who do not
	- SNS in question are:
		- Facebook
		- MySpace
		- Xanga
		- Friendster
- Explains that challenge in researching these differences is due to small representation of non-users in datasets
	- When a large non-user sample base is available, the research has been focused on another topic
- Highlights fact that some research is aggregating SNS into one category but should be disaggregated to identify trends
	- Explains that all SNS have varying features and design, which affect the types of people they attract as their userbase and the types of activities the site encourages
- Challenges for SNS research in general
	- Using surveys may not be the best approach due to large variations in activities and user goals in SNS
	- Most research based on exploratory questions and qualitative methods
	- Most focus on adults
		- But young people are most likely to use SNS

# Landmark

- According to author, one of the first articles to research differences in users and non-users of SNS
- Uses paper questionnaire
- Survey included a question to test participant attentiveness to questionnaire
	- Incorrect answer showed that the participant was not carefully considering their answers and were not included in the dataset

# Quotes

*Include page numbers.*

>people bring constraints and opportunities from their offline lives with them to their online interactions and activities. **pp. 277**

===

>For example, even after women caught up with men (in the United States) concerning basic connectivity statistics, their uses continued to differ. **pp. 277 - 288**

===

>Relying on an online questionnairewhen studying Internet uses could create a bias toward peoplewho spend more time online, given that they may be more inclined to fill out the questionnaire and also, perhaps, more inclined toward higher rates of participation on the sites of research interest. **pp. 280**

===

>there is little difference between young women and young men in the group when it comes to Facebook, Xanga, or Friendster use. **pp. 283**

# Methods and sample

	- 56% female
	- 44% male
	- mean age 18-19
- Research occured between Feb and March 2007
- All from one US college ranked top 10 in ethnic diversity
- Paper questionnaire, collects:
	- Demographics
	- Experience of use (competency?)
	- Types of sites visited
	- Online activities
	- Parental education
		- Used to measure socioeconomic status, rather than ask household income
		- Household income may not be known by students

# Discussion and results

- 56% of Facebook users are women
- Women are more likely to use SNS than men

# My commentary

*About the content, how this might support my arguments.*

- Raises good critical questions about other research
	- Could use this as base for criticisms
	- Especially about the paper questionnaire
- Results contradict with Kimborough2013's statement that Hargittai2007 found no difference in gender
- Limitations
	- No social network data to gauge participant's network SNS preference
	- Research was completed when Facebook recently opened to public, not just college students
