- Examines gender differences in CMC including:
	- SNS
	- Email
	- Video calls
	- IM
	- SMS
	- Phone calls
- Online survey
- Results show that women use CMC more than men
	- Compared to men, prefer to use SMS, SNS, and video calls more
- According to research by Georgia Tech University, in 1994, 95% of internet users were male (Graphics, Visualization, and Usability Center [GVU], 1994)
- Introduction explains that 
	- The early, text-based communication methods via the internet fit in with Eagly's (1987) "Social Role Theory" of men being "agentic", which is to "achieve independence" and to be task focused" **pp. 896**
	- Text-based communication methods did not fit in with Eagly's (1987) "Social Role Theory" of females being "communal" which is "focused on establishing bonds within social interactions"
	- These factors could explain why men adopted internet CMC during the early days of the internet, when at the time, most communication was text-based
	- Female attitude and "communication styles" have adapted to text-based communication, increasing women's adoption to CMC
- The ratio of internet users between genders is now more balanced and the only difference observed by Fallows (2005) is the "motivation and utilization of time spent online" **pp. 897**
- In the advent of social networking, men and women alike were quick to adopt the technology (Mazman & Usluel, 2011) **pp. 897**
