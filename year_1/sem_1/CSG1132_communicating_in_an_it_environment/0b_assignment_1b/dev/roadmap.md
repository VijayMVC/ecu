# Plan of attack

- Use Weiser (2000) to introduce differences between men and women in general internet use

# Questions about the dataset

- Power analysis
	- Is the effect size 80%?
- Can i perform t-tests, ANOVA?

# Criticisms of article

- Does it measure CMC competency?
	- This could cause biased results which can't be identified if not measured
- Online questionnaire
	- Might be biased towards those who spend more time online
	- More inclined to fill out
	- More inclined to use SNS
- Is it observed data or self-reported?
